My original argument was me overlapping the bailout bonuses, with bonuses on the reg.  The bonuses in contract shed light on the situation though, thank you.

Moss is a frustrating topic for me because he was so unmotivated during his brief time as a Raider. It was a terrible signing and he acted like he didn't want to be there from the start. He was a fantastic talent who had an impressive career, but I felt like he could have been more.

Let me attempt to bridge a gap that I think exists between how we're thinking about things. I'll take a couple of similar quotes from you and explain why I disagree. I think you'll see that it's not based on desired outcome, necessarily, but rather assumptions and expectations.

&gt; I think we could all chip in a little, and still have quality care.

&gt; but in theoretical land, if the taxes taken from you were slightly what you pay now for Healthcare, and it was comparable would you still be against it?(or if you had to add a supplemental plan, but it was still cheaper then what you were paying)

Based on my perspective, the problem with these two scenarios is that I don't remotely trust the government to provide quality care with our tax dollars. In my view, the government has shown that it is incompetent to do what it takes to improve the health care system. Therefore, it's not necessarily a question of being taxed more. If they did that, I think those dollars would be wasted. Moreover, I don't believe for a second that improved care can be achieved AND costs can be reduced. I don't believe the government is capable of achieving either, let alone both, and I have plenty of real world examples to back that up.

I'll get off of my soapbox now and get to the other questions/comments.

&gt;Out of control college costs are out of my pay range. I would think there is someone soaking up lots the cash, but don't have much to cite for sources.

It's no coincidence that once the federal government got involved in loaning money to students to pay for college tuition, the tuition increased. It's basic economics. As more money became available, colleges raised their prices. And why wouldn't they? This is a great example of the federal government doing something well-meaning (i.e., giving loans to encourage college attendance among people of all income levels) without thinking through the logical unintended consequences.

&gt;is there any advantage to being owned by stock holders?

Yes, there are many. One is limited liability but that can be achieved even with just a single owner. It's not only a smart initial way to raise capital, but also a continuing source of potential capital. 

&gt;I was wondering if your political/economical views changed with the point of view that career adds, or maybe the education for said career provided? Or were you always around the same belief?

I've always been independent-minded and skeptical when it comes to authority. My career has increased my confidence that the government is more likely to do harm than good. How about your experiences in education or life?

&gt;Do you believe a free market is the best route to finding the means to cheaper, mass Healthcare? Or do you believe certain actors would hinder progress to keep their stranglehold on markets, like gas companies squashing electric cars back in the day?

I think that the free market would provide a better route. No system is going to perfectly care for everyone. I believe the free market would reduce costs due to allowing more competition and reducing regulatory costs (which are always passed along to the consumer).

I don't believe that gas companies squashed electric cars back in the day. I'll tell you my view on electric cars, which I know because I've had some deep inside looks at how this works (based on being very involved with a few clients in the automotive industry). 

My view is that the technology simply isn't there yet. Yes, Tesla is now doing well and other companies are selling electric cars, and people are buying them. I get that. In my view, however, we're still probably 25 years away from electric cars being a neutral or better substitute from gas-powered cars based on factors like performance and price point and convenience. It's amazing what technology has done in terms of bits and bytes - e.g., computers, software, cell phones. Technology hasn't caught up yet in terms of batteries and power; at least in terms of powering objects as large as cars. The government can set whatever target goals it likes but it can't control the rate at which technological advancements are made. Until it arrives, gasoline-powered cars are a much better bet for the average person.

&gt;I would like to advance unions and worker co ops faster then I would social programs.

I have no problems with either of these as long as they are voluntary. As an owner would I want a unionized work force or a co-op? No way. But to each his own as long as it doesn't infringe on my choices.

&gt;They don't deserve to be delegated to a work zombie slave of humans. All my friends who have nice things work 60+ factory hours. My friends who work 40 have an apartment, and thats about it. Again, not saying they deserve the stars, but I feel as if the working class deserves more then it has.

We agree on this and we've now reached what might become a frustrating conclusion for you, but I think we should discuss it.

Why do the factory workers have to work so hard, and why can't someone working 40 hours a week enjoy higher wages?

You're not going to believe this (note the sarcasm) - but I'm going to blame the government again.

What do you suppose happens at my company when the government imposes a new regulation (even one that gives a benefit to employees), or passes a tax increase, or enacts any new legislation that is going to cost money for us? The first thing we do is legally avoid what we can. We can work-around a lot of what the government tries to force us to do. That's been my job for 20+ years.

What happens when we can't legally work around a new cost that the government imposes on us? (Stick with me because I swear there is a point to this).

We have to pass the cost along. Under no circumstances, can we allow the shareholders to have their returns reduced by increased costs imposed by the government. It's our job to make sure that these returns are protected. There are plenty of reasons for this but basically it's what happens in any competitive economy. 

So what do we do? Let's have an example. Let's say the government passes a law requiring companies to give time off for paternity leave. That's great, right? Of course workers will vote for it. What could be wrong with that? Well, ... that raises our company's labor expense. How? We're paying the same salary/wage for less work. So what? We have to recover that cost somehow so it doesn't affect shareholder returns. Don't blame me, I'm just the messenger.

What we do in situations like that is try to offset the new cost with something else. We might cut another benefit, reduce or cancel raises, or even outsource a division to a lower-cost area. My point is that this benefit that is supposed to help workers is paid for by, ... guess who? The workers themselves. 

Think about it this way: have you ever wondered why we have all of these new government-mandated benefits for employees (e.g., mandatory vacations, family leave, improved work conditions) in recent decades, but we also see greater income inequality and wage stagnation? The reason is that every expense imposed on a business must be offset. The only thing that increases worker compensation (or overall conditions) is productivity. It can't be legislated into existence. Shareholders (and I use that term to mean someone with one share in the largest company to a single owner of a small business, and all other owners) will not accept lower returns. They just plain won't. Think about any investments you have. If given the choice, do you go for one with a track record of earning 8% every year or do you choose one that earns 1% every year? Of course you choose the one with the 8% return because you want your money to grow. I'm telling you that's true of just about everyone else.

Anyway, that's quite a long message.

The climate did swing up and down by a few degrees over the last thousands years, but we're already at the upper part of that cycle. Another few degrees warmer and we're in a territory that the Earth hasn't been at for at least half a million years. That could cause some trouble like the permafrost melting which may release more trapped gas and further cause problems. 

Another important thing is the rate of change. Calculus 101. Historically changes have been relatively slow, a degree every few centuries or millenia. This gave nature a bit of time to adapt. Right now the rate of change is 10x higher than anything else in recent geological history. Given the stress we're already putting on nature, it's quite likely that it won't be able to adapt in time in a lot of places. We're already seeing the great barrier reef dying off and desertification accelerating in many locations.

Renewables are somewhat flimsy, but nuclear is a strong option if it weren't for the overly excessive regulation. Battery storage has also improved dramatically recently so 100% renewables is theoretically possible too. 

Solar panels are mostly silicon, a pretty common element, and a conductor like silver or aluminum, which is also decently well available. The doping elements in the super high efficiency panels tend to be more exotic but the cheaper panels use more readily available ones like phosphorus. 

Lithium for batteries is also available in large amounts and could be extracted from seawater, near unlimited supply. If super efficiency is less important than price, nickel and cobalt in the cathode can be substituted for iron which is super cheap, the graphite and silicon in the anode aren't much of a problem.

Wind turbines require concrete and steel for the tower, mostly copper for the generator and more steel, aluminum and composites for the blades. They're modernized versions of downright ancient technology, very little exotic elements here.

Rare Earth Elements like neodymium are used in high performance magnets in electric motors. They're needed to get the crazy performance of a luxury EV like a Tesla Plaid, but they're not really necessary for the kind of car an average Joe would buy. Each car also doesn't need that much of them.

Are the Raiders your team? I'd have to look at some rosters to pick a few teams to follow, hopefully remember a few people.

&gt;Based on my perspective, the problem with these two scenarios is that I don't remotely trust the government to provide quality care with our tax dollars.

I understand not trusting them, I don't particularly, but any entity you would stick between the tax collector, and Healthcare provider would become what we just got rid of(in this scenerio).  I know governments usually suck, but causation doesn't have to equal correlation. I'm genuinely asking, what mechanism stops government from competing efficiently? If they could attract the correct talent,, and implement some bonuses, could they step it up? I'm not pro-government, Healthcare is one of the few issues I feel they should help with.

&gt; I don't believe for a second that improved care can be achieved AND costs can be reduced. 

You might be right.  Maybe a school supplement program to help cover costs, if they can go help the public clinics for X years could help, who knows.

&gt;This is a great example of the federal government doing something well-meaning (i.e., giving loans to encourage college attendance among people of all income levels) without thinking through the logical unintended consequences.

I assume you hate regulations. I dont think they should be handed out willy-nilly, but if the government was giving loans out to help people, I dont feel like it would be out of line to regulate the price.  I'm not a lawyer, so I won't pretend to know how that could be written. Again, this is one of the few areas I would allow for a small government, since every teen entering college is a valuable asset to our country.

&gt;Yes, there are many. One is limited liability but that can be achieved even with just a single owner. It's not only a smart initial way to raise capital, but also a continuing source of potential capital. 

Never learned much about the stock market. I like playing around with crypto, I dont feel like I have enough money to throw in stocks and wait. These few GME and AMC pumps are kind of anomalies right? The quick price rise is what I'm referring to. Coins can make pretty high gains(and losses).  

Back on topic though, how are they a continuing source of capital? Once stockholders buy stock the own it, and  don't pay anymore right? Or do you mean they keep back shares to sell for when they are worth more?

&gt;How about your experiences in education or life?

Eh, I kinda suck thus fair. I was really immature in highschool and college. Wrestling was the only thing I really loved, so I went to college JUST to wrestle. I ended up getting hurt, then dropping out(GPA was shit anyways) I still never cared enough about anything to try at life, till I started fighting. I was 5-0 and had the 170 belt, and got my jaw broke trying for the 185 belt. Amateur, not pro, I wanted to go pro. After that I gave up again for a while.  I've started learning to code, so hopefully I'll have that to add to my pretty empty list soon.  Just restaurant work really, so not much perspectives been gained.

&gt;My view is that the technology simply isn't there yet

370362,[],,MannieOKelly,1392559924.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_fatd6,False,False,,"Well, that helps. Some specific comments: 
1. The labor theory of value is normative rather than positive. That is, it's a statement of what should be and not what is. In all significant production processes, labor is combined with raw materials and tools (capital equipment) to create a product or service (""value."") But here's the thought experiment that should convince you that the labor theory of value is not a workable basis for an economy: robots. As robot-run factories become a reality, how is the no-longer-needed worker being exploited? Screwed, yes, but ""exploited"" suggests he/she created value which was taken away. I happen to think that mass displacement of human workers by AI and robots is a developing crisis of market capitalism, but that's a longer discussion and I don't credit any historical socialist thinker of any stripe with a solution.   
2. Early corporations like the East Indies Trading Company were indeed granted special rights; and a lot of land in feudal days was granted to powerful people by kings others claiming sovereign ownership of a territory, but these are hardly the source of the largest fortunes today: Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs came from modest beginnings. Not sure about Zuckerberg but pretty sure he didn't inherit a significant part of his current wealth. The idea that leading capitalists in the modern US are powerful people set up for success by the government seems way off base. (I am NOT saying that governments don't create wealth for a lot of people via regulation, but I don't think most of that is via secret deals intended to reward wealthy individuals. Mostly it's politicians trying to benefit their voting bases while raising enough money for the next campaign.    
3. Regarding workers owning the factory, there are some pieces missing. Where did the factory come from? (In the USSR, the answer was apparently that the former owners were shot so the factory's cost basis became zero--but of course the workers didn't really get the full benefit of the output even then--the government took what they wanted.  Of course some people could get together and establish a co-op, and they do. And of course there are self-employed people and mom-and-pop companies.  But when mom and pop hire a cashier, does the cashier suddenly become a part-owner of the business?  And when any small business want to expand, if they borrow the funds, do the owners of that capital not get paid? 
4. Intellectual property: I actually agree that a characteristic of IP that should be considered is that it can be used by many people without depriving the creator of his/her use of it.  And standard economics notes that the socially optimum marginal price for information products (music or books, for example) is zero. But that leaves the dilemma of incentivizing the creation of IP.  Why am I going to spend a year writing a book if all I get out of it is the pleasure of reading it myself? Why invest a few billion on research to develop a COVID cure if a generic producer can use my discovery and sell it for just the cost of actual manufacture? Incentivizing investment in IP is why every country has patent laws that grant a time-limited monopoly to an inventor. Patents (and copyrights) are horribly crude solutions to this problem but no one has come up with a better alternative. And some Libertarians think that creators of books and music should be able to charge people for enjoying them forever, including being able to pass the ""property"" to heirs like any other property.      
5. Subsidies to Amazon, etc. Roads? police?  are these for Amazon exclusively? And don't corporations (and their stockholders) pay taxes for those roads and police?

The solutions proposed:

&gt;1) All drivers need to be on the same navigation system. Cars can only be efficiently rerouted if instructions come from one center hub. One navigation system rerouting some drivers does not solve traffic jams.

This only seems like a solution for an authoritarian state with only self-driving cars. Most people don't use navigation during their commutes.

&gt;2) Parking bans. Many urban roads are too narrow and cannot be physically widened. Traffic-flow models can indicate where parking spots should be turned into lanes.

This ignores the benefits of on-street parking in urban areas, elevating traffic flow above other, less incalculable, values. For example, on street parking is useful for protecting pedestrians and bicycle paths from cars. And if parking should be repurposed, who is to say it should go to another auto lane, instead of to trees, pedestrians, cyclists, or public storefront space?

&gt;3) Green lanes. For cities that want to increase electric car use, special lanes should be created for electric cars, providing an incentive for their use.

So, special use lanes? This is not a new idea. HOV, transit, and toll lanes are already a thing, but are typically politically unpopular.

&gt;4) Digital twins. Traffic demands and available infrastructure can only be balanced with digital modeling that creates an entire “twin” of existing roadways. The software will be “an extremely useful thought tool in the hands of transport engineers.”

The real question though is not about the fund itself. It is a simple solution to a simple problem; what to do with too much state income. The first choice was not to use the boon to cut taxes in the moment and to have to raise them later on.

The discourse should, from a philosophical perspective, be twofold. The first aspect on the resource management and ownership questions. In other words whom should benefit from the resources in the ground. Norway chose the the egalitarian ""we the people"".

The latter is how to utilise the income. Here Norway chose to use some, a fair bit, and place the rest in a mix of stocks, bonds and commercial property for posterity. Ideally the fund becomes so large the future wealth extraction does not decrease the size of the fund itself (use the annual dividend after inflation).

Several European countries in the North sea basin with similar social, cultural, political, economic and socio-economic conditions could have done the same as Norway. Denmark, Netherlands and the UK chose instead to plow the state income into the current budget rather than save it for posterity. The NBIM is a result of sound politics and policy. It is, in my opinion, odd that more resource rich countries have not gone down a similar path. 

Norway's oil and gas is offshore where private ownership does not apply. Norway has the, if I recall correctly, position that all resources found in its territory and economic zone is the property of the state within some parameters.

So if I am a landowner and they found oil/gas on my property i would likely get nothing more than a smaller compensation for the use of my land for the resource extraction while the proceeds from the extraction goes into the public purse. I suspect the land might also be expropriated if necessary. It is by design egalitarian.

I never said they were impossible to convert to cash. My point was that it's not fair to put someone in a position where they must sell their stock, which would subsequently be taxed at that sell, just to pay a wealth tax. The whole reason that the stock raised is that the company that they run has created incredible perceived value to the market, in this case some of the best EV vehicles. The tax would require a person to sell stock in a company that they own/run, eroding their controlling stake in said company, just to pay because the government wants some of their money that's already been taxed or will be taxed in the future. 

&gt; Elon Musk ow\[n\]s around 21% of all of Tesla's stock, he is not going to have \[to\] necessarily sell any of that (depending on what other wealth he controls) or even a significant portion of it to pay a 1% tax on his overall wealth 

I found [this](https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-net-worth-quintupled-2020-explained-charts-tesla-spacex-2020-12?op=1) article talking about Musk's wealth breakdown. 80.5% is in Tesla stock, 14% is in Space X, 5.15% is considered other. "" A final $7 billion in Bloomberg's calculations is tied up in cash, homes, cars, and other assets."" As of the article Musk's wealth stood at $187B which would make his wealth tax payment $5.61B according to the article. If you reduced his possessions to zero, you are right he wouldn't have to sell his stock for the first year of the tax. After that he would then have to start to sell his options that he gets as payment since he doesn't take a salary, but even that's not enough to cover the 3%, $5.61B wealth tax. At that point he making less than his yearly wealth tax bill, and has to sell his currently held stock eroding away his controlling interest. Now you have a CEO working for negative money to create jobs by creating transportation solutions to reduce CO2 emissions and exploring space.

Just recently drove by a Model 3 that had a visible step between front and rear door. [This](https://imgur.com/9sxuFh6) was found in Model Ys that have just rolled out of the factory.

A great example of this is nextmove which is an electric car renting service here in Germany. They ordered one hundred Model 3s, when they got their first fifteen vehicles only one in four didn't have a problem, some weren't even safe enough to use. When they negotiated a better quality assurance process, Tesla tried to renege and set a 24-hour ultimatum which led to Tesla cancelling the order of the other 85 vehicles.

On top of that the suspension is set up to minimize aerodynamic drag (to increase range), whereas other manufacturers will prioritize comfort. Not really a negative per se but it is to a lot of potential buyers.

Ironically, rumors are that the Teslas coming out of their new Chinese factory are the best quality Teslas ever.

That being said, the standard range plus model 3 with subsidies is cheaper than the average car in Germany that is bought new (Tesla is 33k€, average is 35k€). The biggest problem really with BEVs is that most people are looking to buy used cars and with the subsidies it makes more sense to buy new. Right now, you get 6k€ in subsidies if the manufacturer agrees to give you a 3k€ discount, doing the math with VAT that works out to roughly 10k€ cheaper for a BEV than ICE.

It's always good to hear anecdotes. I also have friends driving M3s and they're very happy with them and I have also had a Boss with a Model X that was ridiculously bad quality.

&gt;I disagree with your concern about long distances, at least in the US it's the infrastructure that Tesla has created that gives it a competitive advantage over other EV's

I was specifically mentioning that the Chinese M3 SR+ had peak charging speeds around 40% (and that's generous of me) of those made in America because the battery chemistry was changed. This was fixed with an update a week or so ago but they still do perform worse in the cold and customers were stuck with that for 3 months.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;However to dismiss what Tesla's done is a bit disingenuous. Every review of a production EV versus Tesla always seems to say the same thing, it's really nice but technology wise it's 5 years behind where Tesla is right now.

I get where you're coming from, but I do believe that this is a bit of rose-tinted glasses. Tesla's battery is good (very good even), but in some respects they already have to play catch up. The new Model S has to increase battery voltage to compete with the performance of Porsche's 800V battery and Hyundai will also already deliver an 800V powered car this summer.

I don't want to dismiss Tesla's achievements, especially with their superchargers, but I think some people are overestimating how complicated a BEV is. I do believe that a big part of the perception that Tesla is so far ahead comes from their battery sizing. The BMW i3 was an amazing car for what it was but the first three years of production it was only available with an 80mi range because it was estimated to be enough for the average driver.

However, this has drastically changed because of a regulation that all cars a manufacturer sells in the EU in totality are only allowed to emit 95g CO2 per kilometer since 2020 or they face billions in fines (Volkswagen had to pay up). This lead to a lot of new cars hitting the market recently that are very, very good.

The Department of Finance has the overall responsibility to make sure the laws are followed. 

The Bank of Norway (state owned central bank) is responsible for managing the fund. The board of this bank created a distinct department within the bank called ""Investment Management"" to take on this particular responsibility as the bank has other important responsibilities as well.

The board also defines the exact job description for the head of the ""Investment Management"" department, which would be the person with highest decision making authority in how and where to invest/divest. (This job is often described as ""oil fund boss""). 

The current ""oil fund boss"" is hedge fund manager/owner and philanthropist Nicolai Tangen, and the decision to hire him was very controversial due to his initial continued ownership of his hedge fund (he later transferred his ownership share and dividend rights to a charitable foundation after pressure from a number of politicians).

None of this is financial advice and I’m a stupid monkey that eats crayons.

The best thing you can invest in is yourself first. 

Learn the basis of what wealth is and the driving factor that makes things have value.

People may try to lead you to believe that stocks and crypto are going to be your best bet, I would argue that they are misleading you because they aren’t giving you the full picture.

Some people have made a lot of money in the stock market. It takes a lot of research, which requires a lot of time, and even then it requires a lot of luck.  There are unseen and unacknowledged market forces working against just about everything traded publicly.

If you still want to invest in stocks, use your intuition to try to find stocks that have the best chance of rising over time. Try to find a company with good fundamentals and a good balance sheet. Stable companies won’t be over leveraged. Look for companies already investing into emerging markets. For example, society is demanding more electric cars. Tesla stock is already too high, in my opinion, to really be a worthwhile investment, but it may have long term value. But knowing the demand for electric cars is going up, via social and political reasons(government mandates) it may be wise to invest in the components that make batteries for these cars. Also maybe invest in companies or commodities that are related to solid state battery tech.

Crypto is a gamble no matter what people say. Just think about what crypto actually is and you’ll understand why... just like the Dollar it is fiat currency and subject to instability due to external forces.

You may want to consider more of a get rich slow scheme. Find assets that you can purchase at a reasonable value and hold for later liquidation. 

Housing used to be a good investment, and depending on your area it may still be. Tax on capital gains on real estate is 0% up to a $250k gain for single filers after 2 years.

There are lots of ways to make good investments. You just have to be smart about what you invest in.

All of their profit is from regulatory credits:

&gt; By virtue of selling electric vehicles, Tesla receives   automotive regulatory credits. Because it's an all-electric auto manufacturer, Tesla receives a surplus of such credits relative to the minimum required to meet government emissions standards and other regulatory requirements. Tesla sells those surplus credits to traditional automakers, whose limited electric vehicle production means they wouldn't otherwise achieve compliance with regulatory standards.

I want you to stop and considered how absurdly overvalued this company this - they are a car company that has never turned a profit selling cars.

They are valued at 800 billion dollars. to put into perspective how god damn absurd this is, Tesla is worth more than both Ford and GM combined - companies that both, individually, turn a much higher profit and sell vastly more cars than Tesla:

But that brings up something I saw in Who Killed The Electric Car. They claimed that electric cars have far fewer serviceable parts because they don't use an ICE.

I truly believe that a vehicle is one of the most complex software challenges in our times, you only have to look to the challenges to meet ASIL ratings to see the complexity of things to come.

Taxation is theft.  (You see that period, its there, dwell on it, its there for a reason)  

Eat the billionaires, turns into eat the millionaires, turns into eat the 400knaroius, turns into kill the kulaks.  That guy with a cow? He's a traitor!

Why?  Because it's the same evil philosophy that leads you down that path.  

Someone has way more than me.  That's not fair!  I'd be okay if he had 100 times more than me, but he has 100,000x more than me!  I'll never catch up with him, no matter how long I work!

You're right, you won't catch up.  You are not as special as he is.  He invented a way for every computer to talk to each other.  He sold his car to make a better pizza company.  He invented personal computers in his garage.  He invented the assembly line.  He standardized the lamp oil.

Envy drives you to say, I should harm him, as much possible.  He is the least productive part of society because he isnt spending as much as he's taking in!   He's not.  He's rich, and will only invest in things that will make him more rich.  He's efficient.  You will suffer until you are productive, then you will prosper.  Once you prosper because of what you have provided to those you do not know, they will come for your prosperity. 

The environment:

Its a very easy problem.  Every economics teacher on the planet can tell you how to fix it.  Its the tragedy of the commons.  Its the free-rider.  Tax pollution.  As it gets worse, tax it more.

Storage is not the only way to match intermittent supply (from wind and solar) and demand for power.  It's not even a good way of doing it.

Load shaping is the largest part of the solution. Smart meters, smart appliances, and an economic incentive to operate them. Rather than paying a storage provider to store excess power, we pay consumers to shift their demand. 

Suppose our water heaters could temporarily skew their temperature settings 5 degrees lower at the request of grid operators.  Would you even notice? 

How about your deep freezer? Would you even notice if it shifted its temperature setting from 5F to 15F for a few hours? 

Would you even notice if your electric car had 5% less excess charge when you left for work in the morning? 

Desalination, hydrogen generation, Fischer-Tropsch fuel conversion, and a wide variety of current industrial processes are readily adaptable to load shaping. All that is needed is a financial incentive to adopt them.

Toll Roads for heavily trafficked highways and roads.
Proper registration fees for vehicles goes to non-toll road maintenance/creation (aka the rural ones). Could also toss in a real energy use/pollution fee for said vehicle so to really fine tune it so fix the Gas Tax and modify for EVs as an option. You could tweak that based on the Registration Fee i.e. you drove N miles using X type vehicle this year so your Registration costs Z. You could just average this part out so that all that is needed is miles, vehicle type, and general location. Then take a part of the fee and send it to the Federal Government and let them share it out to the non-toll roads in the many States. This would balance out any problems with cross border traffic.

Do I need to write another book or are you seeing the solutions?

Bringing this up is so laughable though. Electric cars are roughly 90% efficient while gas powered cars are 30-40% efficient. Even pissing away another 25% in losses would make your point still unreasonable to even consider. Pretty much everyone who ever visited school will know that converting energy is a far more inefficient process than storing it.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;And the batteries themselves are SUPER dirty to make

True. However, there isn't any current relevant study that doesn't show BEV to be better for the environment TODAY and it's expected to get much better still. For one, decreasing the amount of coal energy will make it more environmentally friendly but even more important batteries out of all propulsion technologies, still have the most potential for development (low cobalt batteries, sodium-ion batteries, glass electorlyte batteries).

Calling Greene, Boebert, Shea, and Ghomert fascists is wrong. In fact it weakens the use of the word for a true fascist. Sure they may have a screw loose and believe conspiracy theories but they are not fascists. 

Many republicans endorsed the position that they felt the election was cheated or lots of irregularities but to say they actively supported an overthrow is ironic. Wouldn’t they be overthrown as well? If not then is it truly an overthrow of half of the people in the government remain? An overthrow means a complete usurp of power or a coup d’etat. Neither happened. And you know who else refused to accept the election...democrats throughout 2016-2020! Are they complicit with this supposed overthrow? After all they spoke about fighting back and not taking no for an answer. Even Stacy Abrams continually called herself the Governor of Georgia after she lost what she called a stolen race. 

In contrast?!!! The Democratic Party has been taken over by the woke mob. 

Fascism, conspiracy theories, overt corruption.....that is both sides!!! Take Whitmer, Cuomo, and Newsome. All Dem governors that dictated lock downs and ruined lives only to have the highest death counts in the country all while they ignored every rule they put in place from dining out, leaving the state, and going to parties. Sounds pretty fucking fascist to me. While states like Florida and Texas and even Trump said stay open, live your life, be smart about it, but we won’t shut you down and dictate what you can and can’t do. As for conspiracy theories the left is so full of them. It’s like Trump triggered a conspiracy endorphin release. From the Russian pee tapes to the vaccine. Biden himself was pushing a theory to not trust the vaccine from Trump before he got elected! Systemic racism is another conspiracy theory to all cops are bad! Overt corruption....omg if you think the left isn’t also full of it. Biden himself is making money from using his position. John Kerry just got caught selling out Israel. Pelosi made millions in stocks when she signed Obamacare. Pelosi’s husband just made millions on stocks in the EV market the day Biden announced the entire federal fleet is going electric. Funny how the day before he bought a shit ton of stock and sold it right after. They are all corrupt.

&gt; This is very well documented, and I'm surprised to hear you claim otherwise. It's based on one of the simplest and most repeatable economic principles you'll ever find - change in price drives change in behavior. If we want people to buy more fuel efficient vehicles, raise the cost of fuel.

I didn't say that higher gas taxes would not ever cause a change in behavior. I said gasoline requirements are much less elastic than cigarettes and alcohol over periods of longer than a week or so. Gasoline requirements can change, it's just a very, very slow change in behavior. No one is going to run out and buy a more fuel efficient car next week just because gas taxes went up today. The average age of cars on the road is 12 years. And only some people are price sensitive to gasoline, so you won't even be capturing all of those people.

Electric vehicles are the future, anyway. And that behavior will change without higher gas taxes. It will happen even faster if (when) electric vehicles are outfitted with photovoltaic paint, so they can recharge themselves for free. But, that won't happen until later this decade.

Taxes aren't the free market.

&gt; You're the one trying to use price controls and consumption limits rather than solid economic policy. And that's just called ""stuff that does not work."" We've fought a 40 year war on drugs over consumption limits, we've watched price controls fuck up markets beyond repair.

&gt;Again, for a free market to function you need low barriers to entry and informed consumers. Once a large corp attains a certain amount of market influence, that creates barriers to entry all on its on. 

If you're talking about large companies that can outperform the smaller competition by offering the consumers a better price or service then I don't see that as a problem. That's a win for consumers. If there's enough demand for an alternative that costs a little more then it's going to be successful as well, look at things like farm to market and free range products. Basically it's not anyone's fault if Facebook has 90% of market share, they have it because it's offering what people want. MySpace at one point had even more market share and look at it now.

&gt;An example: Let's say you have EV manufacturer XYZ, our hypothetical economy has zero trade/economic regulation. That manufacturer gets to market first and grows fast. As they grow, they buy up all of the nickel and lithium supply lines. This would result in an inefficient market as newcomers would either require enough capital to create a battery that doesn't use those metals, or they would have to use our big corps supply, which undoubtedly would come with anti-competitive strings. 

That's a good point, I could see monopolizing natural resources as being a rarer problem that competition could have a hard time surmounting. This isn't a failing of the free market as much as it is a failing of how we come to own natural resources though. I'm personally a [GeoLibertarian](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geolibertarianism), and believe that if we adopted a Land Value Tax it would make it financially impossible to monopolize a natural resource.

&gt;If your product is software for example, that doesn't require resources outside of computers. Markets can be rendered non-competitive by large players who don't make a great product or service. The question is to what extent does this happen, and is the impact significant?

I don't see how this is possible unless there is either  IP law restricting competition or that the demand just isn't there. Removing IP laws would probably help accomplish what you're saying.

&gt;if you bust up huge corps you will create a competitive environment as a byproduct for example.

Sure, but are they still offering consumers the same value? Breaking up efficient companies who charge less for their products into smaller companies who can now charge more isn't a win for consumers. Artificially raising profit margins for the industry by killing the most efficient company isn't how you want competition to work, companies should be out innovated.",True,,False,,,,0,1623624036,,False,0,{},h1o58pw,False,t3_nvtooy,False,True,t1_h1ej6vk,/r/Libertarian/comments/nvtooy/justin_amash_neither_of_the_old_parties_is/h1o58pw/,,,,2,True,False,Libertarian,t5_2qh63,,public,,0,[],,,2021-06,False,,t1_h1o58pw,1627708748.0,False,False,,,2021-06-13 16:40:36

(Obviously you know that the internet started as a DARPA decentralized electronic communications system). Innovation does more to military power than a typical solder.

Who is responsible for results? The business practitioner who allocated resources in a skillful way that, if it were anyone else in their place, there would be ten less hospitals? And then, is it the doctors that saves people or the decision makers who let those doctors exist? Cause and effect/ causality and factual cause are not the easiest to determine but generally some evidence serves to make plausible assumptions that are likely to be true. Typically though, there is always a critical point and a probability point. 

A solder will always fire at an enemy. And if that whole squad falls there are reinforcements. So the actions of that solder don’t mean anything other than insurance payments - the factual cause is by the decision maker that gave the order. The Factual cause exists because of critical points that have 100% bearing on an event - and that even with deviation on the process - those results are assured. But military decision makers aren’t responsible for the power america holds. They like parades - look at the amount of high ranking individuals that would rather parade around than actually killing terrorists. There are many. Worse is, they think themselves as better somehow. 

military leadership doesn’t hold the most responsibility for the rising average quality of life for American citizens.

I think what we are currently starting to see is a bit of both of those, and as a result for example, there is a huge push in my city for food service businesses to use paper straws, even though they are more expensive. Or similarly on a larger scale, the Electric Vehicle trend that has become so mainstream at this point was kind of a collaboration between societal pressure and government incentive. If I could choose one of the methods, I tend to prefer the public resistance method to the governmental regulation method personally, mostly because I don't trust the government to do anything competently. There are also other issues with government regulation. What if the regulation doesn't align with the people's values. That could lead to pressure on corporations like we see china exerting on the NBA or movie companies. Because of government regulation overseas, American businesses are abandoning American values. There are shortcomings of public resistance too, namely trying to get everyone on board and passionate enough to not give up the resistance when the corporations first show a step in the right direction. We saw this succeed recently with $GME and the public not allowing a big hedge fund to get away with market manipulation. The apes held on and one of the companies went under. But when the focus and zeal isn't there we see halfhearted attempts like a previous boycott of Nike for child labor overseas. The news cycle moved on, people wanted the new Js and the boycott accomplished nothing.

I think, honestly, for most of your interactions, maintaining a solid balance of values in your specific locality is ideal.

While I generally agree with your market-based localism, I think the electric car thing also points to its limitations. Even if we had a completely renewable-fed grid, electric cars would not be sustainable at the rate most Americans drive them, because every energy source has considerable environmental cost, and electric cars need huge amounts of energy. Americans think of cars as granting them freedom, but they're a great illustration of how the background conditions of capitalism are created by government (yes, roads), and how those governmental decisions can lock in toxic forms of capitalism. We need more walkable cities and transit, some of which the market can help us with (dense residential infill, for instance), and some that seem to work best with some government help (Europe's transit networks, for instance, though even metro systems seem to do better with more local control, as NYC continually shows). 

I'd also point out that capitalism also has deep centralizing tendencies that do violence to local knowledge. (Am I using a Hayekian argument to criticize capitalism? You betcha!) Capitalism means that bosses have an absurdly disproportionate say over a worker's efforts than the worker herself, and the recent trend has meant an even greater centralization, where investment decisions are largely dictated from finance centers like New York and London instead of the communities that will actually have to live with the consequences.

But despite those critiques, I definitely agree that localism's benefits as far as creating workable political discourse and a manageable space for action are considerable and undervalued. This is a big discussion on the left as well, with left-anarchists and crunchy anti-establishment types on one side, and liberal technocrats and state communists on the other. I'm definitely more in the former camp.

If you haven't read it yet, I really recommend the book *Seeing Like a State* by Yale political scientist James C. Scott. Lots of interesting things in there explaining how. From the conservative side, James Kalb's *The Tyranny of Liberalism* is tightly argued in many parts, though also wades into theocracy at others. I'd generally encourage you to keep an open mind about anti-centralizing left ideologies like anarcho-communism and syndicalism, as it seems like they address a lot of your (sometimes valid) criticisms of the state without falling prey to the disastrous drawbacks of unrestrained capitalism.

The article claims this is also for fossil fuel based vehicles. I won't dispute that, but I wanted to point out that the likely outcome could differ from what the article is stating, while also noting that something could have changed in the time I was last updated on it. 

This article puts forth some things that upset me. Namely:

&gt;this totals roughly $97 in missed federal fuel taxes per vehicle each year, meaning the federal government is losing out on $174.6 million of revenue annually.

They are talking about the stagnant federal fuel tax (which hasn't changed since 1993). 

**This is fucking bullshit**. A government agency shouldn't be interested in making 'revenue' out of thin air (i.e your god damn pocket). What the fuck is this? THIS needs to be addressed at some point. 

&gt;As part of the pilot program, volunteers from all 50 statesâplus Washington D.C. and Puerto Ricoâwho drive both passenger and commercial vehicles will opt-in. Data on the vehicle's travels will be recorded and used to bill the participants according to their mileage, a rate that may vary depending on the vehicle type and weight. For example, commercial trucks may pay more due to the increased wear and tear put on public infrastructure.

&gt;The bill specifically notes that this mileage information can be tracked via third-party OBD-II devices, OEM-collected telematic data, information from insurance companies, a smartphone app, or ""any other method that [Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg] considers appropriate."" It doesn't address provisions for the privacy of this data, nor how it will keep the information safe from bad actors, or even prohibit the sale of the data to non-government entities.

**THIS IS A MAJOR INVASION OF PRIVACY. THEY WANT TO TRACK YOUR LOCATION.** And you know the second layer to this? Cops pulling you over to make sure your tracking systems are working and giving you tickets if the government doesn't know where you are. 

Cops are also known to abuse their power to harass people, like finding out their home address from their computer systems. Imagine if a cop could just pull up your car in Google maps and fucking drive to you

In the instance of hydrogen specifically though, I think it may be more of a private company driven innovation.

As far as the government pushing EVs, itâs probably just a matter of simplicity, and lobbying.

This has been widely floated as a good and more equitable replacement for gas taxes that also ensures that the burden of road maintenance is equally spread between different types of propulsion. A big problem right now is that with the increasing prevalence of electric cars, gas taxes are not providing sufficient income to offset the use. Raising gas taxes effectively subsidizes one mode of transportation, which alters the market. 

This isn't really a new thing: it's been discussed increasingly for the last few years, with several states starting pilot programs to replace gas taxes with mileage taxes. 

Lots of cynical folks here suspect gas taxes won't go away, but everywhere it's been discussed (including by our current transportation secretary) it's discussed as a replacement for the gas tax, not in addition to it.

1307316,[],,Adam_Smith_1974,1611847691.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_9xk4wbi0,False,False,,"No, not at all. What Iâm saying is that if all of our laws regarding pollution were followed with 100% enforcement we may not even need any new laws. I am also saying that if we get rid of government subsidies, waste and fraud that is propping up corporations who just also happened to be the worst polluters, that the invisible hand of capitalism will steer us towards the wisest choice. 

For example, Electric cars were extremely popular around the end of the 19th century. However, through graft, bribery and lobbying the oil industry pushed out electric cars and burdened us with the next hundred years of air pollution. Laws were created in order to favor the oil industry and create the current situation. If no laws existed at all and natural competition were allowed to play out, we may never have had a gasoline dominated vehicle industry to begin with. 

Your way of thinking itâs justâ¦ Narrow minded. For another example: I live in a 40 year old condominium in California. I do not have a garage or a carport I park my car in an assigned parking space in a large lot. The electrical infrastructure for the building is old but functioning as designed. I also on my own business. I donât go to a place of employment every day. Where would I charge an electric vehicle? I work in the housing industry and I can tell you that it would cost more than a Tesla model S to create a charging station just for my unit. Now, what about the other 200 homeowners that live in my community? What about the five other communities on my street? What about 500 communities in my area? If someone passes a law  , Or in my case has a governor mad with power abusing executive privileges, and requires all new vehicles to be electric by 2030 without the forethought of infrastructure it is just a political move to make himself popular and wonât actually ever happen. However a common sense law like requiring all new construction to have charging stations available will, over time, encourage people to make what seems like a more ecologically sound choice. 

Another great example is that every blue trashcan meant for recycling that sits out on our streets in California is actually going directly into the landfill. Thereâs a law requiring us to recycle but itâs not happening. Oh and I would love for you to show me where lithium ion batteries are currently being recycled? Not a drop off location but an actual industrial facility that recycles lithium ion batteriesâ¦ I donât think one exists. There are some starting to come online in the very near future. Nothing nearly large enough to handle current capacity though. So, instead of polluted air and global warming weâre going to end up with toxic cesspools poisoning the ground and the water.

I consider myself a militant environmentalist. But not in the hippie dippy way most people are. I want pristine forests to hunt in, crystal clear water that I can drink with my hand when I go fishing. Iâm in the wilderness often and nothing makes me sadder than pollution. I just canât think of a law or see an example of over regulation or the diminishment of personal freedoms has actually resulted in the betterment of environmental conditions.

Just look at the Kingston coal ash spill that happened in 2008. Itâs widely considered the worst ecological disaster of modern times.  A bunch of bureaucrats wrote letters to each other. Nothing really got fixed, no one ever got held responsible, The cleanup was a joke. It is still recommended not to eat fish out of that lake or many miles down stream. However, if the existing laws were enforced and we threw everyone from earth moving operators all the way up to executives in jail, including EPA inspectors Who failed to do their job, and fined them into bankruptcy then accidents like that would happen much less often.

Many of the root causes of climate change also increase the risk of pandemics. Deforestation, which occurs mostly for agricultural purposes, is the largest cause of habitat loss worldwide. Loss of habitat forces animals to migrate and contact other animals or people which causes the emergence of zoonotic diseases.

Climate change, superimposed onto a dramatic anthropogenic alteration of ecosystems, is leading to a gradual substitution of species, shrinking of ecosystems and decrease in species diversity. These trend-like changes can clearly lead to spillovers in different ways and to closer and more-general encounters between wildlife and humans.

Well, one way is by implementing exactly what a portion of penny-pinching an-cap libertarians have been unwittingly demanding all along: An all-seeing system that tracks  the exact trips of all people who ""use""  roads and bridges and sidewalks and any other kind of public infrastructure, able to bill every individual to the precise cent.

... Alternately, I think accepting a little bit of ""tax unfairness"" is a small price to pay for staving off the privacy-free panopticon. For example, you could tax on tamper-resistant odometer readings. It would be in people's own self-interest to answer honestly about what roads they usually use, if they want them to stay repaired.

&gt; Why don't we just privatize roads

Well, anyone who works with property disputes knows property rights (and privileges like easements) are not actually easy or simple. 

Privatizing all the roads would instantaneously put most Americans into a state of ""landlocked"" property.

To avoid riots and starvation, all those roads would need to have *some* level of government-enforced easements, even if the user claims they can't pay whatever the owner demands... And if you start forcing them to pay ""what they can"" via the courts, well... how somehow we're pretty close to where we started.

You can account for this with a tonnage table. The real issues are that it's self reporting and towing and hauling.

Self reporting is notoriously poor quality. That's way governments have multiple organizations report business dealings with each other to verify all tax information.

We don't have tools for recording towing and hauling distances and loads. Even small vehicles are capable of transporting significant loads that can cause outsized impacts. This risks creating an incentive to used undersized vehicles to transport larger loads creating safety risks.

There is no means of supporting roads without making taxes more complicated from an accounting perspective but there are means to make it simpler for individuals.

Lithium mining is by and large accomplished using brine ponds in the high desert, and it has been shown to be economically recoverable from seawater.  Cobalt is a problem but manufacturers are having a lot of success reducing the amount needed for each generation of batteries.
2. Tesla and many other players are working diligently on battery recycling for lithium batteries.  They will eventually succeed in reducing the cost of this process, given the huge carrot dangling there in the form of tens of billions of dollars worth of metals.
3. Infrastructure can be upgraded to handle it.  It's far easier to ship power down a wire than it is to ship it around the world in an asinine network of quarter-mile long ships, pipelines, and trucks.  Did you know that the electrical power usage of the USA would only increase by about a third if every single passenger car was electric?  I know, I know... hard to believe.  But we use A LOT of electricity, and we use it continuously instead of in short bursts.  Also, I've been to dozens of high speed charging stations in my Tesla and never once seen a diesel generator anywhere.  My car pulls 250kW, initially charging at 1000 miles per hour, which is generally enough to send me on my way for another couple of hours by the time I get back from the bathroom.
4. Most new power generation installed in the last several years in the USA has been renewables.  This makes sense, because solar and wind are now *cheaper* than fossil fuels and don't need constant mining and refueling once they are installed.  What's more, grid improvements that will go along with more charging stations

First off, I think scientific innovation and societal choice (in terms of consumer choice and lifestyle choices) are the best ways to slow climate change and reduce emissions. That being said, innovators and consumers can't reach their full potential in willingly slowing climate change without the financial means to do so. For instance, I am very concerned about climate change, but I can't afford an electric care or to buy a house and outfit it with solar panels.

So I think if the government should do anything about climate change it should start by incentivizing or deincentivising (or both) large corporations (for instance large-scale agro-bussiness and manufacturing) to pollute less and invest in greener and less wasteful technology and methods. Then the actors that pollute the most and are most financially able to adapt have a strong incentive to invest in greener technology and to adopt that technology at a faster rate than ethics of cost alone would dictate. When applied to large corporations and businesses I think either of your certificate ideas would be great.

In terms of individuals I think any sort of carbon taxes, caps or certificates are counter-productive and unethical. I say unethical because doing so is taxing people for things that they need to buy based on a phenomenon instead of a service that tax revenue will return. For instance, a state might have sales tax, which would exist in order to fund things like schools and roads. A tax on gas because is creates emissions, on the other hand, is just a punishment meant to change people's behavior (even though most of us can't afford to change that behavior). 

I say individual taxes on emissions are counter-productive because they take money from people for doing essential things like getting to work, or if you really get into it for buying just about anything because very few products if any can be produced and distributed without emissions. It only hurts the poor and lower middle class aka the people who would be buying electric cars and buying from more sustainable companies if they had more disposable income.

In terms of how government could most effectively and ethically enable individuals to emit less, the best way would probably be to give below a certain income level huge tax breaks or reimbursements for the purchase/installation of solar panels on their homes, the purchase of an electric car, switching to electric heat etc. Doing so helps individuals financially, enables them to make greener choices and leaves them with more money to buy according to their conscience.",True,,False,,,,0,1629505176,,False,0,{},h9qbhh8,False,t3_p83jnn,False,True,t3_p83jnn,/r/Libertarian/comments/p83jnn/externalizing_cost_of_green_house_gases/h9qbhh8/,,,1651620483.0,1,True,False,Libertarian,t5_2qh63,r/Libertarian,public,,0,[],,,2021-08,False,,t1_h9qbhh8,,False,,,,2021-08-20 18:19:36

Long story short, everyone you see on a bike is not in a car.   If a thousand people use the bike lanes a day that would have driven, that's a thousand people not on the road.     


And that means a hell of a lot of things.   It means there's less traffic, and traffic Jams cost the economy an estimated [179 Billion dollars a year](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/24/traffic-jams-how-they-form-and-end-up-costing-the-us-economy-billions.html).   The faster traffic flows, the more the city makes.   In theory the more money the city makes, the more ends up in your pocket as more people can afford your services.  


Then there's slightly less road wear and tear, so your drive is easier with less potholes, and there's less times a year you have to sit and wait while they do road repairs.   Which again, is eventually money in your pocket.  


1000 less cars a day giving off exhaust is a lot less pollution, and even taking carbon out of it, that still means lower asthma rates for the city, better cancer rates for the city, and those end up back in your pocket as the medical costs go down.

In the mid 20th century, along with the nuclear family, the government decided every family needed to live in a single family home- so they created a program to subsidize the development of such homes for white families. In turn, they also redlined neighborhoods (black neighborhoods) unfit for investment. This was when the personal vehicle became more available and we started building everything around that.

What all this didnât take into account, was how much added maintenance this would require, both on roads, and added costs for getting to work for the individual.

The result was highly inefficient development that we canât get away from- I.e. single family zoning in cities where development should be based around efficiency.

Where suburbs become inefficient is infrastructure, utilities and proximity to jobs/resources. 

Utilities operate more efficiently when service is clustered, but utilities tend to be separate from markets so people in close proximity end up covering the costs that people further away should be paying. 

Roads are just a money pit- think of how often they need to be paved and then think of how many there are. There isnât really a better, long lasting way to pave roads so the best way to make them more efficient is to reduce how many there are and give people alternate options so that they arenât overused- thatâs obviously not going to happen with our culture right now. Aside from all that, Iâm quoting from something I heard in the past, but I believe it costs roughly 4 million on average to pave a mile of a two lane road- again, money pit. And suburbs depend on those roads, which are paid for by entire localities.

Finally, those things start to add up when you factor in the fact that everyone has to drive their own car to get to work or pick up groceries. If you want to live that life, fine. But the government shouldnât mandate that everyone does.

Almost no one is willing to tack $4 onto the price of gasoline in a futile attempt to prevent that.

It's going to be solved by improving technology. Solar electrical generation is getting very cheap and by the end of this decade it will be on everything, including electric vehicles. Cars will refuel themselves for free while parked in their owner's driveway. They will sell as fast as they can be produced.

Photovoltaic energy generation will also be on all modern buildings, and retrofitted onto many older ones. They will come with battery packs for storage to cover night time and cloudy days. It is already the law in California, as of 2020, that solar panels must be installed on new residential buildings. Even without laws in other states, it will be the standard  practice nationwide within a few years. That will especially be true if the in-development solid state batteries live up to their promise. 

Between the severe reduction in fossil fuels for vehicles and the need for electrical generation for buildings, a huge part of the demand which is causing CO2 emissions disappears.

Recall the recent moaning among wealth-serving conservative talking heads about how covid welfare was causing people to ""not want to work"" and claiming that there was a ""labor shortage"" while refusing to increase wages or improve conditions.

Dominance allows entities the power to maintain dominance; dominant entities almost always do this. Do you really think we live in some magical reality where the people with power won't use it to maintain their position?

Some historical examples off the top of my head: the old planter elite in the South engineered conditions politically, socially, and economically to ensure that sharecroppers remained impoverished. They used their dominance of politics--gained by way of being the only people with much money and education after the war devastated the region, but feckless politicians allowed them to keep all of their ill-gotten positions--to  stoke racial conflicts which allowed them to manipulate poor white voters; they defrauded illiterate tenants over their accounts while using their influence to prevent public education and transportation infrastructure which might have allowed those tenants more market agency. The fact that those policies ensured that the South would forever be less prosperous than the North didn't matter to the people who were ensuring their continued rule of the South, if the alternative was a decrease in their power.

Or how about when English lords refused to allow Irish tenants the use of anything but the smallest, worst patches of the land owned by the lords to grow their own food, causing  an over-reliance on calorie dense potato crops that could grow in those patches, resulting in massive famine among Irish people when the potato blight came, despite Ireland continuing to be a net exporter of food?

Did you not know that Ford, GM, etc., bought out street car systems and electric car patents at the start of the century just to shut them down, knowing that those transportation devices would compete with the gas-powered cars that they were making so much money off of?

Capital is necessary for work to be useful. People need it for their labor to allow them to survive and thrive. The simplest, most glaringly immoral example is land--if one person owns all the land available to you to work to grow food to eat, that person controls whether or not you can eat. It gets more complicated as you move out from there, but the basic power dynamic remains roughly the same. Those who control the means of production are able to control the people who rely on that production to survive, regardless of whether those are the same people doing the actual producing.

I'm in a VERY blue area of a blue state. A few years ago I moved a few miles across the county border, but most services are still bad.

&gt;being profit-driven and being people-driven seem to be mutually exclusive and that we should err on the side of people

Yes, this gets to the heart of it. I believe governments are less people-driven than most business owners. There are many large corporations that aren't, but let's set those aside for a moment. I'm a small business owner. I'm as people-driven as I could possibly be. Don't get me wrong, I'm profit-driven, too. They're not mutually exclusive. I do the best possible job I can for my clients. I always do right by them and they know it. They trust me and they tell their friends about me. That reputation has led to higher income. That's the right way to do business. If I started screwing people over, I'd earn more money for a little while. Eventually, people figure it out. That reputation will erode and my income will evaporate. 

The big businesses who forgot that lesson are doomed to eventually fail. Reputation only carries you so far. The auto industry is a great analogy to this. The titans of the car industry (domestic and foreign makers) have sat on their asses for years when it comes to electric vehicles. Tesla is eating their lunch when it comes to EVs. The same happens to businesses that care more about profit than people. A new player moves into the market and they start doing things the right way. If you have two options on where to buy something, you seem like the kind of person who would lean towards the more customer-driven business, even if the price is a little higher. I'm that way for sure. The bad company pays a price for not caring about the consumer. They lose my business. The good company is rewarded. 

That's what I think is wrong with the DMV. They're not people-driven in any way. I don't know of any public employees who are, other than teachers (and even that's a stretch in some places).

1606231,[],,hagy,1146829706.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_5g17,False,False,,"That is a grossly incorrect representation of the [IMF report](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/05/02/Global-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-Remain-Large-An-Update-Based-on-Country-Level-Estimates-46509). That report was an exercise in quantifying the externalities of fossil fuel use; it presents the lack of internalizing these externalities as subsidies. From the abstract.

&gt; This paper updates estimates of fossil fuel subsidies, defined as fuel consumption times the gap between existing and efficient prices (i.e., prices warranted by supply costs, environmental costs, and revenue considerations), for 191 countries.

While this is a useful exercise, it is incorrect to present this as a subsidy as commonly understood by a layperson.

For additional details, see this following discussion in Forbes, [The IMFâs Huge Miscalculation of Energy Subsidies](https://www.forbes.com/sites/bjornlomborg/2020/01/17/the-imfs-huge-miscalculation-of-energy-subsidies/)

&gt; Like much else that we hear about energy these days, the story was dramatically exaggerated. In reality, $424 billion is spent globally on fossil fuel subsidies â money that is spent to reduce prices. Thatâs about one-twelfth of the headline grabbing claim.
&gt;
&gt; None of the perpetrators of substantial subsidies are from the rich world: In 2017, Iran, China and Saudi Arabia each spent about $40 billion a year, while Russia, Egypt, Indonesia, Venezuela and India each spent $15-20 billion.

#

&gt; Then how does the IMF get away with claiming that subsidies are 12-times higher than they are â and that the USA is one of the worst perpetrators? By subverting the definition of subsidies.

#

&gt; To implicate developed country governments and create outrage, the IMF adds everything that they believe should be included in the cost of fossil fuels, and say that by not including these costs in the price of fuel, countries are âsubsidizingâ fossil fuels.

#

&gt; So whatâs included in this outsized re-definition? First, the IMF comes up with a price-tag of $2.3 trillion for air pollution. Burning coal is incredibly polluting, so the IMF claims coal is subsidized because it doesnât pay for all the air pollution it causes.

#

&gt; Itâs valid to consider the unpriced costs of any policy â but itâs wrong to call this a âsubsidyâ. And, it is the entirely wrong way to fix air pollution. We should not tax coal but tax coal pollution (along with any other pollution) â essentially forcing coal power to clean up its act. Doing so would cost less than a tenth of the IMFâs $2.3 trillion estimate.

#

&gt; Next, the IMF claims that gasoline and diesel-driven cars cause a huge amount of congestion and traffic accidents. Sure they do â but so do electric vehicles. This is an argument for congestion charges and better road design, safety measures and speed limit enforcement.  The absurdity is revealed when we realize that according to this logic, governments could reduce their fossil fuel âsubsidiesâ by building more roads.

#

&gt; In trying to give grist to environmental campaigners in the West, the IMFâs politically motivated report distracts from the important issue of encouraging the world to dismantle the $424 billion left in fossil fuel subsidies. It might not generate as many headlines, but the IMF should be in the business of careful and sensible economics.",True,,False,,,,0,1633349968,,1633350183.0,0,{},hfcce5j,False,t3_q0tbvm,False,False,t1_hfaxlpi,/r/Libertarian/comments/q0tbvm/joe_manchin_is_forcing_congress_to_think_about/hfcce5j/,,,1647687051.0,5,True,False,Libertarian,t5_2qh63,r/Libertarian,public,,0,[],,,2021-10,False,,t1_hfcce5j,,False,,,,2021-10-04 06:19:28

I have never seen an outright ban on abortions proposed.  Most of the existing laws seems to be aimed at taking on Roe.  Public polling has only 20% support for an outright ban.  Polling does support a ban after the first trimester though which is the law that is going to be put before the court.  People who think abortion laws are anti libertarian havenât spent much time thinking about the issue which is true for most people on the extremes of either side.

Roe should be overturned so we can stop having policy set by unelected judges.  Over turning Roe would likely force both sides to moderate.

What got trump the nomination in 2016 was his demolishing of establishment types like Jeb! Marco Rubio and Kasich. In the debates especially he made them look and sound impotent and insincere as trump would tear them to pieces to cheers from the crowd realizing they had a candidate who wasnât afraid to talk up his policies while similar policies from establishment GOP would only be reluctantly given since they were petrified of being seen as âtoo conservativeâ for the general election. Trump wasnât afraid of this and neither was the public really. Likely because there arenât as many swing voters as we are lead to believe 

But getting back to trump, he was a symptom of a party afraid to push for their own policies. Allowing their opposition to dictate the nature of what is politically acceptable and this discontent from average republican voters had been slowly building for a while. Trump just so happened to ride this tailwind into the nomination, even as the party itself tried to change the rules to prevent him from winning the 2016 nomination.

Think Tesla. Tesla didn't have a line of cars that they suddenly replaced. They were solely focused on EV and then built the fastest production cars with safety standards better than the legacy makers. They didn't just build a car that was EV they built something that challenged legacy cars head on and provided a better consumer offering.

Trump did not want to abolish all taxes or federal oversight. Neither Trump nor Libertarians are anti-vaccine, Trump was one of the first to take it and his administration was instrumental in funding the development of it. Libertarians are opposed to using state violence to coerce people to get vaccinated. Libertarianism is a political ideology, so it says nothing about the validity of climate change. As such, this view is mixed among libertarians. I've never seen a libertarian talk about Q with any seriousness, although I've seen them make fun of boomers for believing in a 4chan theory. The most 'pro capital insurrection' I've seen from libertarians was 'right idea, wrong group'. Trump implemented some gun control afaik, so I'm not sure how he is for *zero* gun control. I've never seen any libertarian hate on electric cars lol. Same with veganism, both have nothing to do with libertarianism.

MAGAtarians are not libertarians, no matter how hard you screech.

&gt;stop gate keeping

No. Every ideology must engage in some form of gate keeping. Otherwise what stops a bunch of communists from saying they are republicans?

No matter how much they say they are republicans, they aren't. Your views go against the core values on libertarianism on far too many issues.

______________________________________

Let's see where you ""MAGA"" people are completely opposite us libertarians:

&gt;Libertarians believe that if someone is peaceful, they should be welcome to immigrate to the United States.   
&gt;  A truly free market requires the free movement of people, not just products and ideas.  
&gt;Libertarians do not support classifying undocumented immigrants as criminals.

Now that doesn't sound very ""MAGA"". Neither does this:

&gt; We are committed to ending governmentâs practice of spying on everyone. We support the rights recognized by the Fourth Amendment to be secure in our persons, homes, property, and communications.

Nor does this:

&gt;Recognizing that abortion is a sensitive issue and that people can hold good-faith views on all sides, we believe that government should be kept out of the matter, leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration.

How about this:

&gt;We oppose the administration of the death penalty by the state.

Please man, where is the ""MAGA"" in all of this?

EDIT: I'm going to keep adding more ""MAGA"" viewpoints. I find it fun. We don't fully disagree with everything the Trumpsters do. But we are definitively **NOT** ""MAGAtarians"".

&gt;The Libertarian Party supports the decriminalization of prostitution.

And: 

&gt;We oppose all forms of government subsidies and bailouts to business, labor, or any other special interest. 

And: 

&gt; The United States should both avoid entangling alliances and abandon its attempts to act as policeman for the world. 

And: 

&gt; The defense of the country requires that we have adequate intelligence to detect and to counter threats to domestic security. This requirement must not take priority over maintaining the civil liberties of our citizens.

And:

&gt; We condemn bigotry as irrational and repugnant. Government should neither deny nor abridge any individualâs human right based upon sex, wealth, ethnicity, creed, age, national origin, personal habits, political preference or sexual orientation.

Oh yeah, and Trumps pick for Attorney General had this to say:

&gt;Some people in this chamber love the Constitution more than the love the safety of this nation. We should all send President bush a letter thanking him for protecting us.

Libertarians believe in fundamental rights for everyone, including right of association.  That isn't discrimination.

&gt;They both hate electric cars which is ironic since companies like Tesla are a free enterprise success story. But since they hate environmentalists so much they must reflexively hate everything considered ""green.""

Why would libertarians hate electric cars?  And Tesla is a **gov't welfare** success story, not free enterprise

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;On a similar note they also hate vegans and oppose plant based and lab grown meat alternatives even though these are both products of capitalism. Likely it is because veganism is tied to environmentalism which they despise.

Ok, now you're just trolling.

Not all libertarians want absolutely zero oversight.  Weâre not all an-caps.

&gt;Zero taxes

Many libertarians simply want reduced taxes, not zero taxes.  Most non-anarchist libertarians recognize the necessity of taxation in some form.

&gt;Anti vaccine

Libertarians are not anti-vaccine.

&gt;Climate change denial

In my experience, most of us recognize the existence of climate change,

&gt;Both believe in Q anon conspiracy theories and believe the 2020 election was stolen from Trump

Clearly you donât hang around libertarian spaces much.  Qanon and election truthers arenât welcome.

&gt;Pro capitol insurrection

My experience has been quite the opposite on this front.

&gt;Zero gun control under any circumstances

Is this supposed to be a point in common with Trump supporters?  Because they were twisted themselves into pretzels trying to justify the bumpstock ban, âTake the guns first, go through due process laterâ, and cracking down on 3D printed guns.

&gt;Pro discrimination (only difference is libertarians will say they don't support discrimination personally but they're OK with private businesses having Jim Crow policies)

Some libertarians oppose the Civil Rights Act on freedom of association grounds; I think those people are fools, and I have no problem with laws banning private discrimination against people based on factors they have no control over.

&gt;They both hate electric cars which is ironic since companies like Tesla are a free enterprise success story. But since they hate environmentalists so much they must reflexively hate everything considered ""green.""

Iâve literally never encountered a libertarian who hates electric cars.  

&gt;On a similar note they also hate vegans and oppose plant based and lab grown meat alternatives even though these are both products of capitalism. Likely it is because veganism is tied to environmentalism which they despise.

Again, Iâve never heard of opposition to lab-grown meat.  The only opposition to veganism Iâve seen is to anyone talking about *forcing* veganism on others.

&gt;Both want religion in schools since libertarians want to Abolish public schools.

Not all libertarians want to abolish public schools.  Beyond that fact, the real problem with religion in school is when itâs in public schools being forced on students.  If you choose a religious school, whatever.

&gt;Both like to whine about SJWs and feminazis ruining gaming.

Again, never encountered this one.

&gt;Both have an unhealthy obsession with anime and My Little Pony.

Seems to me like youâre building your view of libertarians off of one particular person you knowâ¦

&gt;No voting as there wouldn't be any democratic institutions, just private power. You'd have to own stocks to have influence on anything.

For something like the fifth time, not all of us are an-caps.

&gt;No public services or first responders. House burning down? You'd better have your credit card ready if you're going to call the fire department brought to you by amazon.com

Once again, not all libertarians want first responders to be privatized.

15. Community services run on mutual aid and to a lesser extent private contractors would probably arise as the typical strategy for firefighting as opposed to for-profit, individually-hired companies. Private firefighting firms would certainly exist, but it's not like you'd be haggling on the phone while your house is burning down. That's what subscriptions are for. And no, ask any Trumpie if they want to abolish state firefighting, the answer will be no.

10) No, actually, I think that the meat industry just waste our resources, so ideally I'm a vegan for economic purposes, but I think that the economic damage of banning the meat industry would be too big and probably would end up affecting a bunch of poor people, I think that the lab-grown meat and the insects companies have a much bigger potential to get cheaper than the meat companies, these alternatives use much less than half of the cows that the meat industry use for the production of one kilogram of meat, that means these alternatives are more productive and competitive, they just need some research and development to substitute the meat industry, that's why, again, I support deregulation, much lower taxes and cutting subsidies for the meat industry, so that these alternatives can develop and get strong enough to compete and eventually create a vegan or near-vegan society, without the need of am economic crise;
11) Yes, I want private schools, but I don't think they should be religious, I mean, they can be religious, but I think that under a free market, that's not the tendency, religious schools have more costs than secular schools (hiring more teachers for religious education, churches, anything that symbolises christianity) and tend to have less clients, because parents from other religions probably won't put their kids into these schools, even today's some big private schools aren't religious, Harvard is an example, so, there would be religious schools, but It's highly improbable that every single one of the schools will be religious;

Greenhouse gases warm the atmosphere. But there are people on the political Left who have realized that environmentalism is a powerful political tool. It's very similar to animist religion. It helps people find meaning in life. And it's very convenient as a tool to fight capitalism, which inherently creates pollution, waste, etc. The more amazingly productive capitalism is, the more byproducts it creates.

So they continually exaggerate environmental threats in order to raise money and support for Leftism. In 1970 it was widely reported that by the 80s hundreds of millions of people would die of famine. Global cooling was also supposed to be a major threat back then. After over 50 years of this environmentalist movement warning of apocalypse, environmental problems have proven to be extremely mild in the grand scheme of things.

Global warming is not an existential threat to humanity. That's a ridiculous lie. Natural disasters are predicted to get 5% worse, true, but also occur 25% less, and fewer humans than ever are dying of natural disasters because we keep getting better at dealing with them. Very few Americans die of natural disasters and that won't change. The economic damage done by global warming by 2100 is estimated by the UN to be something like 2% less growth, far less damage than any of the government solutions proposed to deal with the problem. Barely anyone alive today will be seriously effected by global warming or climate change.

Having said that, global warming is a potential very long term problem for our grandchildren and their grandchildren, and it makes sense not to use up all our fossil fuels when there are renewable alternatives. Considering that, government funding for research and reasonable subsidies for renewable energy and vehicles that can run on renewables make a lot of sense. The switch to electric vehicles is already inevitable. So just gradually switch to nuclear energy, with some wind and solar mixed in where practical and the problem is solved.

Okay, except modern internal combustion engines are very efficient and we've minimized a lot of pollution from cars. Yet coal fired plants put out just as much if not more emissions than all cars combined.

So what could we do? We could pull our heads out of our butts and just start using nuclear tech. Yes, I get the concerns, but I honestly believe that nuclear may be our stepping stone to the future. It's going to take time to convert everything to green tech. It's going to take time before solar accounts for the majority of our power supply. But in the interim we could start replacing coal plants with nuclear right now. And that would require politicians and business leaders to get on the same page and get it done.

The issue with human caused climate change for me is not do human cause it? However, to what degree do we contribute to it? Can we quantify X increase in CO2 = Y degrees change. All the climate models I have looked at cannot accurately quantify this because of the very nature of how we construct those models. We can all agree that pollution is bad and we need to move towards renewables/clean energy (btw EV vehicles really are not a clean solution to combustion engines) but the pace this is being pushed needs to be slowed imo. Economically we will have serious energy shocks and crises that will lead to dead people if we do not handel this transition carefully. There is a ton of venture capital at work to develop alternatives and increase energy efficiency. This will take time.

Lastly, OP there is much gloom and doom on this topic and alot of cash in the gloom and doom business. That gloom and doom ignores human history and our ability to adapt to new challenges/paradigms. We will likely not reverse any temperature increases, if we humans are 100% at fault for Climate change, for the next decade but we will become much better at mitigation.

I hate to break it to you, but support of this administration is already deep in the red. If they can recover from this point, it would be one of the wildest comebacks in the political history of America. 

Many people are obviously upset over the whole Afghanistan ordeal, and with good reason. We have to consider that this didn't just hit America and Afghanistan, it massively strained relations with other nations who had to scramble to rescue their soldiers and citizens as well. We didn't see much of it in American media, but other foreign media was *blasting* the way that this was handled by the Biden Administration. 

Many people are upset by the lack of delivery on campaign promises, which if anyone says they're surprised, they're lying. Biden is a notorious political flip-flopper. Take legalizing Marijuana for example, they campaigned on this as well as possibly commuting sentences. Obviously that was never going to happen, because Biden penned and spearheaded the 1994 crime bill that turned the US into the prison state it is today. Biden can't do that because that would be stabbing himself in the back, as well as irreparably destroying his ties to certain unions and lobbyists. Rather than legalizing Marijuana, he bans menthol cigarettes. Where he promised more freedom, he instead strips more away.

His popularity is plummeting *fast*, obviously among the right but also among the left. 

Not to mention the fact that the people lack faith in him, especially after the Afghanistan deal where the nation needed a leader, he came out for a total of 18 minutes to shift blame and say it wasn't his fault, and then turned around and hopped on a plane to go back on vacation.

A good platform is great, I'm sure it helped Biden a ton, but people need to see that it's being followed through on as well.

The Covid-19 vaccination rollout and so on coming from Biden got a ton of people back to work. The significant job creation (on track to beat Obama's huge 8 year record in only 2), the rise in wages being the best in 40 years, and the dramatic fall in the unemployment rate (the economy recovered far faster than expected) are all big things for Democrats to cheer on about. 

The American Rescue Plan, the protection and expansion of National Parks, the end of arctic and new public land drilling (and the Keystone XL Pipeline). Biden fixing up the Education Department to forgive $11.5 Billion of student debt in the coming months. Are all big things that people should care about.

Add that on to that the anti-discrimination policy for housing that Biden was also quick to implement. The drawing down of private prisons as well. His LGBTQ protections. And the Federal minimum wage (even if the Congressional one didn't pass) was a huge help. This stuff affects people on a very personal level, and we should be pounding that drum whenever we get the chance.

I'd imagine that a libertarian government would acknowledge that and probably come up with something similar to a carbon market... because it's a market.

If we assume that crony-capitalism supports the oligopolies in the auto industry, then yes. The on-boarding to electric vehicles would reduce manufacturing costs in general and consumer maintenance.

Same with car insurance mandates, if I crash into a car, thereâs a guarantee that legally to drive, I need $50,000 in bodily injury coverage in Ohio. 

Expecting society to front the cost of corporate environmental damages is a regressive corporate handout.

Iâm not asking for licenses, no zoning, no permits. But you must reasonably bond or insure likely damages to occur.

I agree. A universal list of things which are off limits is very useful and should absolutely be employed. I just don't see any other way of composing such a list than by societal consesus, so society will have to decide what society is not allowed to decide about.

Tesla in itself is a con which outperforms all other EVs, because they actually loose money, don't make any profit and stay afloat by deploying some very dubious practices. But that's a topic for another day.

I think I could make an argument that well run unions provide a degree of economic resiliency to their members, a resiliency that pays public dividends when those members need fewer unemployment benefits, have better healthcare, and might even have some sort of pension or retirement plan.  
  
The rationale behind Obama's individual mandate was, in *part,* that it's personally, socially, and economically responsible for someone to own health insurance, likewise, it seems to me that it's personally, socially, and economically responsible for someone to join a union.  I'd never call for an individual mandate to unionize, but I am okay with our government providing incentives for socially responsible behavior.

Unions were also the onceâs who started âimmigrants take jobâ because they wanted their union numbers to go up. 

Hereâs my experience that you wonât hear from most people. Young people will never vote for unions because it impacts their ability to make performance based money. Meanwhile in unions, you just need to do bare minimum to get annual raises and eventually you are in a warehouse where the young ones are getting 1/4th of the salary of senior employee and producing twice if not more all. I have seen high performer employees going to standard rate and eventually leaving jobs because they found it unfair. Union doesnât mean itâs helpful for all, itâs helpful if you donât know your rights.

Union also donât get stock ownership, a tool thatâs actually used for creating wealth and unions are deprived of it because of short term job comfort. In long term, unions will never make as much as they could have without Union. Stop living in the past and learn current business environment. Itâs also unfortunate that half the American workers donât have college degree leaving going for unions as the only job choice.

Damn guess we shouldnt have any saftey features or regulations at all if deaths are acceptable.

Not true in any way. Motercycles are linked to higher congestion on interstate highways and cities. Fine in rural areas congestion wise though. 

&gt;Well on a planet that's experiencing climate change, how does ~50 mpg sound to you? Where gas will become more and more expensive motorcycles offer a far better option than your gas guzzling SUV's and sedans. All while using a fraction of the resources to make the machine!

Electric cars and public transportation are both more effective if your goal is talking climate change. Also most pollution is caused by manufacturing. (And even within transportation freight transport accounts for over 70% of CO2 emissions.)

&gt;Parking spaces multiply when people ride motorcycles.

That would require us to change our current infrastructure for parking. Public transportation also reduces parking congestion and is more effective at it.

&gt;And have you ever heard of the Hurt report? MOST MOTORCYCLE DEATHS ARE CAUSED BY PEOPLE DRIVING VEHICLES INTO MOTORCYCLES. If anything we should ban cars.

More facisious arguments You are ignoring the operator of vehicles in this whole theory of yours. The HURT report found that motercycles where a more dangerous form of personal transportation. That was the point of the paper. More deaths would have been prevented if all driver where is passenger vehicles instead of motorcycles.

&gt; The top is dominated by a few hyper-productive individuals

And here is where the any agreements I have with you end. ""hyper-productive"" sounds great until you realize what these people actually *are*.  I'll continue with this below. 

&gt; The top 40 list is dominated by the top 1% of all musicians. The best selling books are dominated by 1% of authors. Movies are dominated by the top 1% of actors.

No one, and I repeat,*no one*, of worth or importance is suggesting that all musicians, actors, painters, authors, dancers, professional eaters, etc. should all be valued identically. So the point you're trying to make here is entirely off the mark from the start. And with extremely few exceptions (Rowling and Spielberg are the popular examples), the major of major league players in these professions are still small fish in a big pond relative to the people we're really talking about here.

&gt; If you look at most of our self-made billionaires today, they have done the same thing.

Here's another dicey term of dubious worth: ""self-made"". That's a discussion for another day but ""self-made"" is a ridiculous term to use in front of the word ""billionaire""

&gt;  Bill Gates brought computing to the masses. Steve Jobs put the book of knowledge in your pocket. Musk revolutionized space travel and electrification of the auto-fleet. These are world changing things which generated feedback loops causing resources to pour into their companies.

Did Steve Jobs actually ""put the book of knowledge in [my] pocket""? Or was it a team of people that took an existing technology, streamlined it, and Jobs sold it to the public? What did Musk revolutionize exactly? Electric cars existed way before Tesla, which I might add, is only still in business because the government gave him a shit ton of money early on. And why didn't you mention Zuckerberg? Or how about the Kochs or the Waltons? The Murdochs? 

&gt;  You want this! Everyone benefits

I want innovation and increased technological power of mankind, of course. But saying ""everyone benefits"" is either extremely naive or a flat-out lie in hopes I'm ignorant of world history and politics. There's more than a few countries on this planet who, historically, may have something to say to you about how much they've ""benefitted"" from the effects of Western consumerism.

Perhaps we should also talk about the power of the billionaire class when it comes to things dominating the public forum on things like public health or global warming? Or a thousand other things they historically don't care about because it really only affects those not-at-the-top

&gt; To do otherwise doesn't distribute wealth more equally, it means the feedback loop is interrupted, and wealth isn't generated at all. Everyone loses.

This is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to say anything more. I'm not advocating for a Soviet-style redistribution of all land and private ownership across the board. But to suggest that ""everyone loses"" when we interrupt the wealth of the wealthy is the dumbest thing I've ever heard. For fuck's sake, even the goddamned Romans gave bread to the plebs at subsidized prices or at times for free because it benefitted society..

&gt;  Prices Law says that 50% of all work is done by the square root of the people in any group. If you have a team of 25 people, 5 of them will do 50% of the work. 

lmao No, that is not what Price's Law states, for one thing. For another, that's not even an economic law and has, and I cannot emphasize this enough, NOTHING to do with economics.

No its not. Dismissing every advantage and lucky break in life as proof that your gains are ill gotten is what losers say.  We all stand on the shoulders of giants in some way. None of us would be here if the alphabet wasn't invented, but that doesn't mean that I don't earn my lot in life fair and square because I became educated from books.

Yes, Steve Jobs did it, and he did it with the team of people he put together in his company. Did he single handedly build the product alone? No. Would it have happened when it happened if he was never born? Also no.  The credit is his.  

If I need to explain what Musk revolutionized, then we certainly do have nothing to discuss.  Electric cars would still be decades away from mass production if not for him.   I would add to that he hardly made it. Tesla and Space X were both on the verge of failure at one point in time.  Had the eat the rich crowd had their way, they would have sucked all his capital gains from selling PayPal, and you would have neither company today.  This example also touches on the interruption of the feedback loop you dismissed.  

The ease with which people dismiss him as lucky, or crooked, or undeserving baffles me. These are people who have blessed all of mankind with the advancement of technology in profound ways, literally creating wealth out of thin air and improving the life of every single person on the planet. And the jealous vipers among us have nothing but contempt for it.  You're lucky they exist!

Trump is a great example of a person who inherited his lot, and spent more time manipulating the system then generating any true value.  **There are billionaires who's wealth outweighs their contribution to society**.  This is not a thing without warts and poor examples, like Zuckerberg.

But no system is perfect and we live in a world of tradeoffs, and by going after the whole lot of them because you perceive them all as the same, is throwing out the baby with the bath water.   It WILL result in stunted innovation, and lower living standards for all.  We're talking electric cars in 2050, not 2020 (great for global warming!).

Punish them? What in the name of fuck are you talking? Even with the wealth taxes I'm in favor of, these people will still be mind-boggingly wealthy. They wouldn't be *as* wealthy, but we could also fund things that lift a shit ton of people out of poverty and get them better access to things they desperately need in order to get out of the rat race. If the ""punishment"" is that Bezos is only worth $100 billion as opposed to $200 billion, then I am sorry but you and I have very different understandings of what ""punishment"" means. 

&gt; No its not. Dismissing every advantage and lucky break in life as proof that your gains are ill gotten is what losers say. 

By your own admission, you are both lazy and stupid, so maybe be careful about ""what losers say"" my guy. I, on the other hand, am neither of those things. And I have *never* in my life suggested that billionaires get to where they are purely by stroke of luck or who their parents are. You're putting words in my mouth there, chief.

&gt; Would it have happened when it happened if he was never born? Also no. The credit is his.

And this is how I know you don't actually know anything about Steve Jobs. Maybe do some investigation on this one my guy, I'll let you figure this one out on your own. 

&gt; If I need to explain what Musk revolutionized, then we certainly do have nothing to discuss. Electric cars would still be decades away from mass production if not for him.

So I guess we'll add ""electric vehicles"" to the list of things you don't know very much about. Mass production wasn't the innovation of Tesla and I'm shocked you're typing so confidently without knowing that. Multiple companies already had electric vehicles and were continuing to develop them further. What made the original Tesla Roadster great was the fucking battery and it looked cool

&gt; The ease with which people dismiss him as lucky, or crooked, or undeserving baffles me.

You're missing the point. Those of us that don't like him do so mostly because he's a) a douche and b) shows zero sympathy for those who weren't born to two independently wealthy people and are not currently worth over $300 billion...a net worth that wouldn't exist if the government hadn't subsidized the shit out of his companies. He follows government money but still has the whole ""government money for me, none for thee"" mantra going, which is douchey and hypocritical

&gt; It is what it states, and your making strawman arguments now.

Price's Law is very specifically about scientific authorship and isn't a hard fact taken at value by any economists whatsoever. It was also not a strawman fallacy as I didn't create an incorrect version of Price's Law to use as an argument against. 

&gt; Mostly when we adopted western values and the notion of equal application of the law. It's called the Meritocracy.

I'll ask again: When? You can ballpark it if you want. Decade or century, doesn't matter. Give me something to work with here and we'll see what history has to say.

Trump is a great example of a person who inherited his lot, and spent more time manipulating the system then generating any true value. There are billionaires who's wealth outweighs their contribution to society. This is not a thing without warts and poor examples, like Zuckerberg.

I never said there weren't. Our problem, however, is how much wealth is specifically in the hands of an insignificant amount of people. 400 people own nearly as much money as the US Federal fucking government will pull in this year. You're sitting here defending them, which is fine, that's your right. But I don't think you're thinking about this as we are. Given the subreddit we're in, I'd wager you're more or less against things that the rest of the world has like universal healthcare, paid maternity and paternity leave, raised minimum wages or trade union necessities, etc. Fine. I get it. I don't subscribe to libertarianism anymore, but I do understand the thought process. But it's still *unhealthy* to have such a small group of people hold onto that much money and the **power** it literally buys them. It's a reallllllyyy bad idea to let the few have the levels of power that they wield with *zero* ways of defending against them like voting them out or something (inb4 ""just don't buy their stuff"" as though that's an option..)

You can fanboy all you want, but it's extremely worrisome that we're concentrating so much goddamn wealth in the hands of so small a few, at the expense of so many.

&gt; We're talking electric cars in 2050, not 2020 (great for global warming!)

This might not even be a problem if it wasn't for **the uber-rich** in the first place. You're throwing all these words around to defend people like Elon Musk when his peers are the very people who covered up the issues he claims to be currently trying to fight. 

&gt; Space still being expensive to access (no starlink, which will bring cheap internet to poor nations and rural areas).

I mean, you have to know that this isn't some crazy innovation right and had we funded NASA properly over the last few decades, we could have gotten that regardless, yeah? Also, you may want to check out some of the many criticisms Starlink is currently facing..

&gt; Smartphones and all the progress they enabled being invented 10+ years later. Amazon, maybe never happens.

1983969,[],,joey24984,1504563140.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_crfjmsn,False,False,,"In my Microeconomics class I wrote a paper expressing how this type of tax system is unfair and in effective. One example that was used was the argument that you should be taxed for using the highway at peak hours since you are causing congestion and therefore more pollution. However one of the most basic examples of a product that is inelastic is gas an oil. It's unlikely that many drivers would make the switch to a completely electric car especially since now they have more income going towards taxes. Furthermore the reason that highways get congested at the times they do is because of workers traveling to and from work. These workers can't just use a highway at a different time so they will just eat the cost of the tax.

This is a smaller example but it is still true that gas and oil are relatively inelastic, and that many industries would be forced to pay a tax due to a lack of alternates. On top of all this, this tax structure disproportionately effects smaller firms and the poor who wouldn't have the resources to make the required purchases to move away from carbon emissions and you would in fact be eliminating them.

Not to mention I find this structure highly immoral both due to it disproportionately effecting the poor, and also due to the potential misuse and misunderstanding of the costs of externalities. One example of this was the idea to use a similar system for Covid vaccines however this would be done as a credit instead of a tax. The idea being we calculate the benefit of the vaccine and pay everyone who gets the vaccine best on the net benefit on society it was having. Sounds like a good idea right? However as I pointed out at the time there wasn't enough information to go off of to actually come up with a dollar amount that was based off science. All of the credits that were proposed treated the vaccine as a one time thing and therefore calculated it's net benefit to society based off of only needing to take it once. As I pointed out at the time, Pfizer and Madera had both mentioned that initial research showed Tha vaccines started to significantly lose efficacy at around 6 months meaning that boosters would be required. Sure enough months later this information became confirmed. This would have meant that people would have received a credit disproportionately high compared to the net benefit of the vaccine they took, since over time the benefit would go away.

The potential of misuse in this type of tax structure is exactly why I think it should never be used. Just because a tax is calculated based off the cost of externalities doesnt mean that the user can avoid those externalities and/or pay the full cost that they owe. Innacurate models will often lead to mispriced taxes and honestly this system is disgusting especially in the hands of the government.

Long story short, I agree with the opinion of the speaker, that the earth probably can afford to support billions more people who all live extravagant 1st world sort of lifestyles.

The key to allowing this lies in technological advancements, for example:

\-nuclear energy ought to be adopted by more countries (it is extremely powerful and efficient, and produces zero carbon emissions). They talk about the carbon emissions of France(a heavily nuclear dependent country) vs Germany for example.

\-Wide spread adoption of nuclear energy would dramatically reduce the cost of electricity thus making the desalination of salt water and the production of fertilizer through electrical means  increasingly feasible.

\-increased access to fresh water and fertilizer would decrease the cost of farming, and consequently the cost of produce in many areas

\-Genetically modified animals that can be created and grown in environmentally sustainable ways are also on the way, like what the company AquaBounty farms is doing; Farming gmo salmon that â....are engineered to grow faster than their non-genetically modified counterparts: the gene alteration means the fish eat 25 percent less feed and reach market size (about 10 pounds) in half the time â roughly 18 months.â

[https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2019/07/28/aquabounty-farms-united-states-first-bio-engineered-salmon-indiana/1528588001/](https://www.indystar.com/story/news/environment/2019/07/28/aquabounty-farms-united-states-first-bio-engineered-salmon-indiana/1528588001/)

More of this would of course offload some of the pressure on the ocean/ocean floors/and reefs by reducing the need to fish.

And there are a bunch more examples he talks about on the podcast related to electric vehicles, aquaponics, and more- So again, the future does not have to be a bleak dystopia where only a select few can enjoy meat once a week while the rest of the plebeians eat butter made from insect abdomens spread on fo-steak substitute:

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belgium-cake-bugs-idUSKCN20M23U](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-belgium-cake-bugs-idUSKCN20M23U)

Lastly, i think we should staunchly oppose anti human sentiments like what was mentioned elsewhere in this thread, human proliferation is not inherently evil. And Morally bankrupt ideas like genetically engineering people to be shorter so that they and their children require less energy to grow, be transported...Or genetically engineering humans so that they are allergic to bovine proteins, thus forcing people into vegetarianism or veganism or any authoritarian, top down solution along those lines may have disastrous consequences for our species and society(and yes these things are being talked about):

&gt;I can't find anything to suggest that this is true on the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_SpaceX)

Fair, I was thinking about Tesla. My bad on that. Still, a rocket scientist he is not. Nor is he a mechanical engineer, so the advancements coming from spacex aren't actually his, they're of people he pays.

&gt;Actually NASA developed the first reusable booster but it was unreliable and ultimately abandoned... Also NASA literally says money by having SpaceX do its resupply missions. The tax payer sure is losing out on that deal...

So, to be clear, they just made something that already exists, but better AFTER the group that invented it stopped. But also, no NASA doesn't ""save"" money by having Spacex do things. NASA had their budget slashed and Spacex isn't paid by NASA. If NASA was directly paying Spacex it'd be a big loss for NASA, but if they weren't getting that money regardless, it could cost 1000x what NASA would cost and it would still be a bargain for NASA.

&gt;&gt;No other space organization is being given both a mandate, and billions of dollars from America to do it.

&gt;Because that preceded the out of the box thinking that we're debating about here. 

This is just sad.

&gt;&gt;Read: worse rockets that cost more money, and pollute the Earth worse BUT make more money from the government.

&gt;They're literally better (in that no one has a better rocket) and cost less.

No, they're quicker to make, and cost more in fuel, which also pollutes more.

Electric cars? They've been around for over 100 years and the only reason no one has made them in mass quantities is that there is less money in it than in gas powered cars. That's not innovation, that's selling a niche product to a niche audience.

Paypal? It's a way to buy stuff online. That didn't exactly take a genius level intellect to think that that might be a thing if you knew about the internet. Put a catalog online and then have a way to pay for stuff? Damn, that's just having a store but with more steps.

It's funny that you bring up company towns and child labour. Child labour has always been far more prevalent in socialist/communist societies, than in capitalist ones. And company towns had like zero signs of a private sector. They were owned and controlled by a single state-like organisation, and were essentially monopolies. In a healthy private sector, competition would prevent working conditions from falling.

I think we'll see semi-trucks make the transition to electric in the next 10 years, if only because the technology hasn't quite caught up to the full range of their duty cycles.

There are *literally tons* of boats that are full EV at this point, from small pleasure craft to bass boats and yachts. You're probably talking about cargo ships though, and again that becomes something where battery technology hasn't caught up to the duty cycle yet. There's a few small examples like the Yara Birkeland which is fully electric, and the Maersk Pelican which use magnus effect rotors to generate energy, and a bunch of weird sails that I haven't really looked into.

As far as airplanes, AirBus, Rolls Royce, and Eviation are already test flying electric airplanes. Like some of the other examples, you're going to have to change your expectations of how air travel happens, and electric still doesn't work for all duty cycles. Most of the EV aircraft are sub-15 occupant vehicles and have 400-600 mile ranges. Which means flying cross-country might start looking more like a series of quick connections.

&gt;This is a total myth, we used to have walkable cities with decent transit before lobbying by the car industry.

Lol, way to oversimplify and completely misunderstand a complex situation.  
https://eh.net/encyclopedia/urban-mass-transit-in-the-united-states/
  
By the time the auto industry came along street car businesses and such had been pissing people off with poor service and strangling under contracts and regulations they had agreed to for years, that's why they could be bought up cheap, and they were only in major cities. Most of the US never had mass transit.  
  

&gt;SUVs and pickup trucks have proliferated due to low gas prices. It's time for that to end.

No, they proliferated due to their utility and they're not going anywhere:
https://www.ford.com/trucks/maverick/
   
I've got my order in for a hybrid Maverick to replace my 25 year old truck rather than fix it up again, because they finally hit a price point I was willing to work with on something I can use.  
And the EV trucks are coming:     
https://insideevs.com/car-lists/electric-trucks/

And you're just as far off in stating this:  

&gt;living closer to work, driving less, and buying more efficient cars

Closer to work? Do you think people commute for fun? I commute 20,000 miles a year, even at $5 a gallon in my 17 mpg old ass truck instead of my 4 cylinder work car my commuting costs and my mortgage wouldn't have eclipsed the expense of buying a comparable home closer to my job. Housing close to good employment is *expensive*.  
  
And drive less? How exactly? I mean, other than consolidating errands to minimize trips (which many do anyways), where are they supposed to stop driving to? I mean, It's not like most people are just wandering around, they're going to necessary places to get and do necessary things, so what do you think they're going to do except maybe cut pleasure travel and reduce vacation spending?  
  
It's the same with buying a car. Next to a home a car is one of the most expensive purchases people make in life, there's a reason that the average age of a car in the US is over 12 years, and it's been rising every year.  
https://www.cars.com/articles/average-age-of-u-s-vehicles-hits-record-high-surpasses-12-years-437017/
  
My gas bill for commuting doesn't even come close to the full coverage insurance costs and payments on a new car. Hell, even when I drove my truck it wasn't even close. Spending thousands of dollars a year on payments and insurance in order to save a few hundred bucks on gas isn't saving anything, so while it might influence their next vehicle purchase to some extent it's not going to be a primary motivator for most people to switch cars.
  
When the fuel costs go up and start driving up everything else it's a lot easier to put off that weekend getaway, patch your jeans, or hold off on that new video card than it is to buy a car or a house.

Think about how often you see lines at the gas station.

Let's do a fun dead-reckoning here. Let's assume:

* A medium-size gas station may have \~12 pumps.
* Let's say that every car that comes there is filling up a 15 Gal tank .
* It takes 5 minutes to fill up a 15 Gal tank. (3 gallons/min)
* Assume cars get on average 25 mpg

So the relevant information gathered from this is:

* Each pump delivers 75 miles of range per MINUTE
* The station with 12 pumps is providing 900 miles of range per minute when all pumps are running.

This means that when the station is beyond full capacity, the demand is to provide more than 900 miles of range a minute.

Now let's look at an EV scenario. There are three levels of charging and there is some nice data breaking down the different [charging levels and how long it takes to charge.](https://www.carfax.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-to-charge-an-electric-car)  In short:

* Level 1: 5 miles range per hour (Residential mostly)
* Level 2: 25 miles range per hour - (Residential mostly several thousand dollars to install)
* Level 3: 200 miles range per hour

**Level 2 is what you will find at most public charging stations**. But those would be typically in a place where you would be getting out of your car and walking around. Let's provide a scenario where these gas stations were all converted into Level 3 rapid charging stations providing 200 miles range/hr for each fast charger.

Assuming that the distance people are driving does not change, to be able to accommodate the same 900 miles/minute provided by a gas station you would need to have **273 LEVEL 3 chargers** (which provide 3.3 mi/min). This obviously does not take into account that people are also charging at home. But even if we cut the demand in half, we'd still be looking at needing over a hundred charging stations to meet HALF of the demand. I'm not even going to get into how that would be technically challenging in terms of power distribution and amperage.

**And most of all let's take a moment to** [**consider where we're getting that electricity from**](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/electricity-in-the-us.php)**.** 60% from coal and gas. Which at the end of the day means we're effectively creating an unsustainable strain on the power grid which is going to directly increase carbon emissions from coal and gas power plants. A standard car engine gets somewhere between 25-30% efficiency (total theoretical energy of fuel vs actual energy produced) while coal power plants operate at around 33% efficiency. Natural gas is generally a little more efficient, but really depends on the type of plant they are running.

So at the end of the day, you are putting a MASSIVE strain on the power grid which WILL require trillions of dollars of spending to accommodate the increase demand (and more likely have a lot of cut corners leading to blackouts), trillions of dollars retrofitting gas stations to be charging stations or acquiring new land to build massive charging station locations and an insane amount of e-waste from old EVs that have unusable batteries in them.

This is not a simple problem of ""let's all get electric vehicles and save the world"" Despite this being a great thing to aim for, we are FAR from this reality. Unfortunately, the standard democrat approach is to ignore reality and only create policies to enforce the ideal endpoint despite the massive hurdles they are ignoring (these hurdles often times directly impact lower income families as well which they claim to care about). The standard conservative approach is to get stuck in the weeds and never moving towards the ideal endpoint at all.

It's absolutely a chicken and egg problem, we need reliable quick charging stations and clean energy to rationalize the move to EVs, but we don't want to invest in these quick charging stations unless we have a large amount of EVs to service. This was way too thorough of a response to an offtopic conversation about insider trading.

I differ on the worker cooperative.  I'm not against them and if a company wants to go that route I'm fine with it but don't think they necessarily are more productive or beneficial to people.  I think history tells the opposite through the Pareto principle.  Pareto says 80% of outcomes come from 20% of people and it's not theory as much as human observation.  Any sector of anything wether entrepreneurs, athletes, musicians, tradesman, employees etc. has certain people that are HIGHLY productive or idea people that produce and most people are just nominal to poor workers.  Example, would you rather have Lebron James or 3 extra highschool basketball players?  Would I rather have Elon Musk or 100,000 customer service reps.

What part of ""almost"" didn't you copy?  CO2 is naturally occurring. It exists in human breath.  Animals and plants emit it.  It is an essential component of the environment.  We depend on carbon for our very existence.

Heat pumps?  Do you realize there are natural gas heat pumps?  Absorption heat pumps can use other heat sources as well (solar, geothermal, district steam, &amp;c).  Determining efficiency of electric vs. gas heat pumps depends on use case.  Part of the issue is just how cold it gets, and this how much supplemental heating is required.

Not to mention a level 1 charger can take up to 40 hours to fully charge your EV. Not really an option for anyone who travels long distances (consider trucks).

The main point is that this would be a massive strain on the electrical grid for a relatively insignificant benefit to the environment, but it appears that point was not made clear enough for you. It's not as simple as just saying ""okay let's all drive electric cars"". From what I can find, EVs get around 3-4 miles per kWh and americans drive on average \~ 13k miles a year. There are roughly 225million drivers so we're talking about the electrical grid needing to support roughly:

**835,000,000,000 kWh per year.**

To put this in perspective, the average US household consumes roughly 11,000 kWh per year so that's equivalent to 76 million more households on the electrical grid. That is far from insignificant.

Not sure what you're trying to accomplish by nitpicking a couple figures in a post that makes several points. Maybe my figures are off, and they certainly could be because they're just quick google searches, but it doesn't change the magnitude of the problem and the fact that it's a lot more nuanced than ""EV is better for the environment"".

In the US it is due to regulatory requirements. Other countries are creating a similar situation. It's not that the auto manufactures are taking a gamble (aka big bet) but are rather being told that they need to develop this technology. It's far from superior in any way shape or form with the exception of a slight emissions improvement, reduction in routine maintenance and awesome 0-60 times. By the nature of the battery, your standard EV is going to weigh 1k pounds more than an equivalent ICE (even with a full tank of gas). have a shorter range, require a much longer time to refill/recharge, if you use fast charging you reduce the usable life of the battery. The braking will not be linear due to regenerative braking. Vehicles will be limited in size due to the heft of the battery. At some point in its life an EV will require a battery replacement that will outweigh the value of the vehicle. Battery replacements are North of $10k. Because of this, EVs will not last as long as an ICE etc. 

Just think about it, EV's have been around since before the ICE. The only major step that has been made in that time is the advancement of a higher capacity battery. Government subsidies are the only thing that has made them viable. Nobody is going to buy a Chevy Bolt for over $40k, with the exception of a narrow group of individuals, when they could just buy a small displacement vehicle for a fraction of the cost that gets close to the same real world savings. It just doesn't make sense not to.

The subsidies are not going away. The subsidies are not for gasoline but for crude oil. Gasoline is a product of refining crude.

After owning dozens of different gas-powered cars over the years, I bought a used Tesla model S two years ago and it is, by far, the best car I've ever owned.

The acceleration is exceptional, it has great responsiveness and little or no body lean, the electronic features are great, it's extremely low-maintenance because there's no engine, the cargo space is better, I never have to stop for gas, and it even out-performs other cars in crash tests because there's no big, heavy engine to crush the driver on impact or to screw-up the car's balance. And I should mention, there was no subsidy because it was a used car purchase and the vast majority of the federal new car subsidies were phased-out by 2019. Yet sales have sharply increased since then.

Also, the price gap between EVs and gas-powered cars is shrinking rapidly, and on a total cost of ownership basis, EVs will soon win-out due to the lack of gas purchases and engine maintenance.

Meanwhile, you can drive up to 500,000 miles and still have about 80% battery life with an EV. The battery will out-live the car and can be used for all sorts of other purposes which certainly isn't the case with a gas-powered engine.

And that comparison is based on a 2014 model. With the advancements that are being made in EVs, the gap will only grow over time. For example, range has doubled since my model was made. Innovative EV makers, particularly Tesla, have also been responsible for a majority of the advancements in electronics that have been adopted across all new cars (auto-pilot, lane detection, backup cameras, integrated GPS, all sorts of voice command and hands-free options, etc.).

Finally, consider that Tesla ranks #1 among all automakers in customer satisfaction and that's long before we've reached critical mass with a national charging network and service centers in every city.

Granted, subsidies are often needed to generate customer trial in the early stages, especially when our entire national infrastructure is set-up to support the competition.

They were receiving subsidies even before Tesla was a threat to any of them.   

&gt; Yeah and Tesla would've died without those subsidies... 

Tesla would have died because the government was subsidizing its competition not because it wasn't able to compete on its own.

That contradicts your previous statement with regard to Amazon and the local grocery store. The local grocery store is the startup and Amazon is the big dog, so what you said is that the subsidies wouldn't help the startup grocery store. Now you're saying the opposite.  

&gt; You're basing this all on amount and not timing. That's my point here.  

Fisker took the subsidies and died, so it was neither the amount nor the timing. Tesla just had a viable business model. Subsidies don't change that in either way.

1. All the automakers got bigger subsidies with which they could have developed an electric car but they didn't. Instead, they used the money to build gas-guzzling competitors to Tesla.  
2. Tesla's direct EV competition (Fisker) got subsidies, but they died.  
3. The oil companies got **the biggest subsidies**.   

So there is no way the subsidies will give you a competitive advantage over your way bigger, way better funded, and way more subsidized competitors (and enemies).",True,,True,,,,0,1639759698,,False,0,{},hoxrako,False,t3_ri5rip,False,True,t1_hoxp6lf,/r/Libertarian/comments/ri5rip/deleted_by_user/hoxrako/,,,1655891534.0,1,True,False,Libertarian,t5_2qh63,r/Libertarian,public,,0,[],,,2021-12,True,,t1_hoxrako,,False,,,,2021-12-17 09:48:18

A large engine weighs 300lbs... Your Tesla battery weighs 1,200lbs. Your motor and gearbox weighs 175lbs. Are you studying up before you retort?

&gt;Meanwhile, you can drive up to 500,000 miles and still have about 80% battery life with an EV.

What salesman sold you on that lie. LOL. You might get 12 years before needing to replace the battery. You will be at 80% at the 8 year mark. The battery is good for 1,500 charge cycles, or just over 4 years if you were cycling it everyday but age also wears a battery.

Don't forget that your battery is proprietary. Tesla Roadster owners found out the hard way how much that sucks. [Here's a used Tesla Roadster battery for sale](https://www.ebay.com/itm/253000782441#viTabs_0). They only want $19k for it. 

&gt;Also, the price gap between EVs and gas-powered cars is shrinking rapidly, and on a total cost of ownership basis, EVs will soon win-out due to the lack of gas purchases and engine maintenance.

I partially agree with this statement as long as you sell the vehicle before it needs a new battery, but, then, what do you replace it with? You will need to buy another vehicle. There's a good chance you will buy it from a dealership and thus you will have to pay taxes and then your vehicle license tags will be higher (if you have those) and so will your insurance.

&gt;And that comparison is based on a 2014 model. With the advancements that are being made in EVs, the gap will only grow over time. For example, range has doubled since my model was made. Innovative EV makers, particularly Tesla, have also been responsible for a majority of the advancements in electronics that have been adopted across all new cars (auto-pilot, lane detection, backup cameras, integrated GPS, all sorts of voice command and hands-free options, etc.).

The average EV battery life is 17 years and it can be much longer if you charge properly (keep it between 20-80%, only use superchargers when absolutely necessary, etc.). In fact, my 2014 model is 7 1/2 years old, yet is still getting 94% of the range it had when new. My car was already 5 years old when I bought it, yet I could easily own it for 10 years and never replace the battery. And even if someone wanted to replace the battery, they'd get some money for the one they've got to help offset the cost of the one they are buying. So, it's a net replacement cost, not purely incremental. 

Meanwhile, with regard to safety, I'm talking about the fact that a big, heavy engine sits in front of the driver and passenger in a gas-powered vehicle. That creates a major safety hazard in a front-end collision, even with systems that trigger the engine to drop on impact, and it puts more weight on the front axle and affects the vehicle's balance and performance. Because EVs have the weight more evenly distributed, and because it's not positioned in a place that can injure or kill the driver on front-end impact, they have better safety ratings and perform better in crash tests. For example, most Tesla models get 5-star safety ratings in every category. Plus, they perform better in terms of evasive driving because of the superior weight distribution, acceleration, and responsive handling.  

Keep in mind by the way that we're just talking about full EVs. There are also hybrid and plug-in hybrid options that make-up the rapidly-expanding inventory of electric options.

A gas engine will go 300-400k miles before any major engine repair would need to happen and even then you could buy a used motor for $1k or have your engine rebuilt for $3-4k.

&gt;Meanwhile, with regard to safety, I'm talking about the fact that a big, heavy engine sits in front of the driver and passenger in a gas-powered vehicle.

A gas car weighs about 1k lb less than a comparable sized EV and that is without the use of aluminum. Is 200lbs a big heavy difference to you because that would be the difference in engine/gearbox weight between the front engine on a dual motor Tesla and a 4cyl FWD vehicle. If the vehicle is not FWD then the gearbox would be positioned in the tunnel much the same way the battery of an EV is except it will weigh a thousand pounds less. 

&gt;Plus, they perform better in terms of evasive driving because of the superior weight distribution, acceleration, and responsive handling.

Tesla's do not perform well at higher speeds because they are optimized for reduced drag. You cannot reduce drag without compromising high speed stability. I would agree that low speed maneuvering they would be decent with the extra weight positioned low in the chassis. Tire life might not be so great though. Other cars in the same price range would probably be superior in handling if that is what you are going for but EVs would be generally good with the exception that they would weigh 1k pounds more than other cars in their price range.

My battery is already almost 8 years old and still has 94% of the original range. Meanwhile, although I tend to buy new car every 5-7 years, there's no reason that I would be forced to get a new battery if I wanted to keep my car to where it was 15 years old or more. Even if I only had 80% of battery life, that's still 212 miles of range which is more than triple the amount I generally need for daily use, and that's with a 2014 model. Newer EVs have 350 miles of range on a single charge and would therefore still have 280 miles of range after 20% degradation. The whole battery replacement thing was only an issue for people who owned early models like the Nissan Leaf which only went 75 miles. With the newer, long-range batteries, it's a non-issue. The battery will out-live the car and even at end of life, it still has value because it can be re-purposed for many other uses. 

In fact, the current average lifespan of a gas-powered car is about 12 years or 200,000 miles. For an EV, it's about 50% longer and that will only improve over time. Tesla is currently developing a battery intended to last for 1 million miles.

As for the safety, most Tesla models have achieved the highest safety ratings of any car model in their class with 5-star ratings in every category and sub-category. The lack of an internal combustion engine right in front of the driver and passenger is a key reason. It greatly increases the crumple zones and removes dangerous components that otherwise impact the cabin in an accident. It also greatly improves the balance of the car which makes Teslas a much lower rollover risk. 

And again, gas-powered cars have had a 100-year head start both in terms of the technology improvements for the car itself and in terms of building a national network of gas stations and service stations to support the industry.

That's due to accidents and other issues. The head will be the first mechanical part to go out on a ICE and those will last 300-400k miles. Other issues that would cause a shorter lifespan would also effect EVs. Combustion engines are actually very reliable. For having so many parts, they are very simple. The main wear item is going to be the valves. EVs will have a shorter lifespan by the pure nature of the proprietary parts. Again, an ICE is comprised of many parts and those individual parts are affordable. An EV is not. Any mechanical failure on the drive system of an EV is going to be very expensive. Transmissions are the biggest failure point due to the torque. That is why most EVs only have 1 speed and are limited to ~100mph. Even the new Hummer EV with 1,000 HP is limited to 106 mph.

&gt;And again, gas-powered cars have had a 100-year head start both in terms of the technology improvements for the car itself and in terms of building a national network of gas stations and service stations to support the industry.

The first EV for sale came out in ~1890. It's taken over 130 years for EVs to transition from open cell lead batteries to lithium. They have just never made sense. People are able to justify it today because of subsidies and hype. I do not see the momentum subsiding anytime soo though. Regardless, if you keep your EV past 200k without replacing the battery, good luck selling it.

2142591,[],,mikmckn,1550445011.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_2al31tqn,False,False,,"\#1 first and foremost is following the actual science. We must be aware of our impact on the planet and strive to live in some semblance of harmony if we wish to continue to exist on this rock. Earth doesn't need us nearly as much as we need her. 

\#2 Reduce energy consumption where possible. Reduce waste in all things from food to manufacturing. 

\#3 Energy. We have spent billions on pie in the sky dreams of chasing 100% renewable energy and ignored that wind and solar simply do not have the energy density needed to run a modern society. We need nuclear power, and specifically, 4th generation nuclear power.

It's a hard pill to swallow, but we are not going to get there immediately. If we were to magic a Libertarian Socialist confederation into power in the USA (where I live) we would still need to run the factories and mills and shipyards and mines. We are still going to need trucks and trains to feed and provide for everyone because that's how our existing system works. If we cut all that off, we're going to have famines and shortages and it's going to be chaos. But what we can do is recognize that capitalism has dictated the almighty dollar as the measure of whether or not we should do something, and that this foundational principle has to change. With enough energy, we can power electric trains to move goods across the continent. We can power electric trucks using a 3rd rail to manage intermediate distances. With enough energy (not just electric) we can operate massive steam desalination plants on the west coast to reduce California's usage of the Colorado river, freeing up water for others. We could consider water pipelines from other areas which aren't feasible at the moment because of the cost of pumping water long distance.

And while we're building the big infrastructure, we complement it with efficiency improvements and waste reduction so that we don't need to continue the massive infrastructure construction, but rather sustain ourselves.

I also like the idea of openly working with our neighbors. For example, if we were to work with Mexico to build a canal, we could flood a portion of the Salton basin close to sea level (it presently sits below sea level) and have a natural port near to Arizona and Nevada. This would not only alleviate the respiratory problems that come from the Salton Sea drying up and blowing toxic dust all over the Imperial Valley but would add a natural ecosystem that can support waterfowl, migratory birds and sea life. Access to local fishing would enable people to supplement their diets with locally caught fish and shellfish. It's a protected harbor for shipping and avoids a couple fault lines.

Canada likewise, has enormous water reserves that go basically unused in the north. They could be tapped to pipe water down to the Western USA without endangering any of the natural ecoology of the Canadian wilderness currently occupied by more than a few First Nations. By stopping our dependence on the imaginary valuepaper, we can look at big projects like this and have something to offer in return that has real value. Large pipeline projects often rely on reservoirs that impound water which means hydroelectric power is a possibility and would be very welcome in the northern areas of Canada.",True,,False,,,,0,1640300915,,False,0,{},hpqp2mj,False,t3_rn1a4t,False,False,t3_rn1a4t,/r/LibertarianSocialism/comments/rn1a4t/what_is_the_libertarian_socialist_solution_for/hpqp2mj/,,,1655867120.0,4,True,False,LibertarianSocialism,t5_2qpfx,r/LibertarianSocialism,public,,0,[],,,2021-12,False,,t1_hpqp2mj,,False,,,,2021-12-23 16:08:35

Is this money going to be used to plant forests to act as carbon sinks? Or is it going to be used to run TV ads encouraging people to ""turn off the light""? Is it going to be used to make the electrical grid more efficient, or is it going to be used to put up billboards encouraging people to buy LED lights? Is it going to be used to pay for implementing EV charging stations, or is it going to be used to hire some public speaker at the next county conference?

Tell me what the money is *ACTUALLY* being used for, and I'm more inclined to consider it. But if you can't tell me what you want to do with it, and how much it will cost, I will not support giving more money to the government for some nebulous cause just so they can ship some more pork to their donors.

The equivalent is asking gun owners if they support ""gun control"". Well no, we don't. But then you say ""Oh so you think convicted murder-rapists should be allowed to own guns?!?!""

The total value of subsidies that Tesla has received *ever* is $2.5 billion. Tesla has received about $11 billion from *private* funding rounds. Out of that, $400 million was a loan, which he paid back to the government 9 years before it was supposed to be paid back. A lot of the subsidies were also EV tax credits, which benefit the consumer, not Tesla itself. And due to Tesla hitting the milestone of 100,000 EVs sold early, it stopped receiving said tax credits, whereas its competitors still get those credits, therefore hurting Tesla. Moreover, despite making a net loss over the past 3 years, of about $516 million, it still paid income taxes worth about $460 million over the same time period. It has paid off about 20% of its total subsidy value received by the government *ever,* over the past 3 years alone, and that is only through income taxes, not any other type of taxes. In 2020 alone it paid $262 million in income taxes, 10.48% of its total subsidy amount, in a single year. This is not including the $11 billion that Elon is gonna be paying out of his own income this year. So I believe the government has been more than paid back by investing that small minute amount in Musk. SpaceX doesn't count as the reliance on big government money, since:

1. SpaceX relies on *government contracts,* which is different than, say, a handout or a subsidy. A contract means it's a market action, with the government as a consumer and SpaceX as the seller. SpaceX is selling something to the government in exchange for money. That's not exactly the type of reliance you're talking about. 
2. The only reason SpaceX is reliant on government contracts is due to the immense government regulation of the industry leading to the government being the sole consumer, and private consumers being locked out of the industry due to high artificial barriers of entry set by the government itself. If barriers to entry were lower,  SpaceX wouldn't have to use government contracts to survive.

Industries get preferential treatment based on past unfairness, so in 30 years we give tax breaks to electric car companies because they where disadvanted when trying to get established due to oil companies having been disadvantaged, then 30 years after that we give hydrogen vehicles tax breaks because they had an unfair playing field due to those electric tax breaks they had to compete with when they where getting started?

Some people straight up deny it, which angers me as it's basically just their way of saying ""I'm too lazy to change my lifestyle to keep the planet alive"". Others are just Leftists who think their policies are actually effective. Let's get one thing straight. Climate change is primarily happening due to mankind and we have to fix that. The thing that I don't like about the Left is how they are completely irrational about it. They wanna get rid of nuclear energy because it's dangerous (it really isn't) and they say that it's a good thing anyway because the energy created by nuclear will be replaced by renewables. It triggers me so much. You should be worrying about getting rid of fossil fuels first, especially coal, and then worry about nuclear, not that there is any real threat to it anyway. Germany brags about its renewables when France already makes 80% clean energy through nuclear. If those nuclear reactors were to shut down, the country's CO2 emissions would skyrocket. Leftists also seem to think that everyone can afford an EV when in reality, using a synthetic biofuel is generally more reasonable. In fact, a lot of the poorer countries who don't have the possibility to buy electric cars tend to use biofuels made locally, like sugar cane in Brazil. They don't use EVs because they're too expensive. Also, note that having an ICE car running on synthetic fuel is always going to be more environmentally friendly than using and EV on 100% green electricity, so it's technically better for the environment. Back to what I was saying, these Leftists literally live in the most advanced countries and they expect more undeveloped countries to switch to renewables. A good example of these people is Greta Thunberg. She lost a lot of credibility when she declared to be against nuclear energy. But that doesn't matter to her. She's from Sweden, a country who could easily switch to 100% renewable energy and expects the rest of the world to do what Sweden can. Another thing that doesn't make sense is how the Left often mixes climate change with their economic ideologies. The reality is that capitalism has a large role in making those renewables. While I think that corporations need to have regulations on CO2 emissions, I have no doubt that it's through these corporations that we will find alternatives to fossil fuels. Formula 1 is currently the leader when it comes to finding sustainable fuel and they're a multi-billion dollar industry. Who's going to possibly supply 3rd world countries with clean fuel in the future if not them? If it wasn't for these companies creating these alternatives, there wouldn't be any renewables in the first place. I heard of an interesting story a few days ago about a possible future in nuclear energy based around fusion instead of fission. This type of reactor wouldn't need uranium, it wouldn't take up much space, it would be impossible to have a meltdown and the energy created would be at least 4 times the amount of modern reactors. However, it's not the tax loving Left-Wing that's funding these inventions. Without capitalism, these inventions won't become reality. You can't just expect to change everything by taxing the rich. In a lot of countries, the rich don't exist and so they need something that's affordable to make the change.

Sorry for the long comment btw. I think I should probably note that as you guys can see I'm quite the environmentalist. I'm part of a branch of Libertarianism that's called ""Green Libertarianism"". It essentially means that pollution breaks the NAP. But, seriously people underestimate the effect that climate change is having on the planet.

When he bought Tesla they were building  a Lotus Elise EV conversion that was nothing at all like the modern EV's the company builds today, mass transit ridership was declining long before the pandemic got people to rethink sharing an air box and seating with a bunch of unknown people, and mass transit is useless outside of the cities and as remote work becomes more and more the norm post-pandemic people will expand on and continue the trend begun during it of moving to more affordable communities away from the large cities.   
  
You speak of the ""future of mass daily transit""? Most people don't use it now, even in places like New York, LA and Chicago, let alone anywhere else in the US.

And about 4.5 million employees in it. That means the majority use personal transportation to get around.

But at the same time - they would be about 222 electoral votes.  You'd need 48 of the remaining 316 electoral votes, and could get there pretty easily with other super-safe blue states.  And this wouldn't require you to win *all* of the popular votes in NY and CA, only 51%.

The state with the most trump voters in 2020 was ... California.

In this scenario the Democrats could probably lose the popular vote by a substantial margin and still win the electoral college because of how many electoral votes they'd get to capture via winner-take-all from CA and NY.

EDIT: to put some numbers on it - in 2020 Dems won CA and NY by about 63-35, and in the rest of the country it was about tied 49-49.

Imagine CA and NY were half the population, but each state also shifted towards trump by ~17 ... then Dems would win CA and NY by about 54-44 and lose the rest of the country by about 41-58.  Total popular vote would be trump winning 51-47.5.

But in the electoral college, Dems would win NY, CA, IL, DE, WA, CT, RI, ME-1, HI, MD, MA, VT and DC.  By my count good for ~56 EVs (once you haircut the other states because they'd presumably have fewer EVs if CA/NY had more), and still win the electoral college (if they won Illinois which would be the tipping point state).

We should not be teaching it. Do you think that if this generation of kids grow up to topple the government that theyâre going to rebuild anything other than the USSA?

We should teach about racism and the history of black slaves. Of course, those are important historical facts that do play some roll in the current situation and we need to acknowledge them.

&gt;Everything is EVs now. Is there anything there not patented? Did Tesla, GM, or Nissan develop the first EVs without patents on their technology?

There's a lot of complexity involved. Much of the tech for EV was patented ages ago but was held from the market. This slowed innovation.

Also, much of the currently patented EV innovations are licensed between automakers. The existence of the patents system both incentivizes and necessitates its use, so when one competing company obtains patents and that drive up the cost of protection, others must do the same. 

So, in the end, consumers lose because innovation stalls due to limited competition and prices rise due to the same monopolization of markets.",True,,False,,,,0,1643260683,,False,0,{},huehrz0,False,t3_sdcmzo,False,False,t1_huef9ve,/r/Libertarian/comments/sdcmzo/worker_rights_and_state_rights_are_not_the_same/huehrz0/,,,1645293956.0,1,True,False,Libertarian,t5_2qh63,r/Libertarian,public,,0,[],,,2022-01,False,,t1_huehrz0,,False,,,,2022-01-26 22:18:03

Can be a libertarian that virtually agrees with everything else another libertarian believes... to find out you both disagree on one of these topics.

So, find your own path.

If you think climate change is a real crisis that demands drastic action then you can very easily start to think it may even demand serious government action to go along with personal responsibilities.

But... yeah!

Exactly.  It isn't a strictly libertarian stance... because for some issues there isn't a ""strictly libertarian stance.""

Abortion has always been recognized as another such issue.  There is no ""strictly libertarian stance"" on topic.  You can argue pro-life side and equate to murder with need to control other peoples' actions to save harm to another ""life"" or you can make various different arguments that are pro-choice (most not recognizing personhood of aborted fetus... but some going as far as to recognize personhood of fetus and still dismissing its relative value!)

&gt;but they're not libertarian arguments.

I don't completely agree with this dude's paper even... but think it does a Great Job illustrating ""libertarian arguments"" and how much more depth the ideology actually is than fairly mindlessly just thinking libertarianism is ""government bad"" and nothing more.

I actually think this link sums up ideas best though:  https://www.niskanencenter.org/libertarian-principles-climate-change/

&gt;I donât mean to argue that libertarians should be taken to task for forwarding arguments outside of their ideological hymnals. One could make a strong argument, after all, that libertarians have little to offer to the environmental debateÂ as libertarians. But if one wishes to carry the banner of âprincipleâ in this conversation, those principlesÂ do not sit comfortablyÂ with the arguments forwarded by many self-described libertarians. And they certainly canât be marshaled against those who maintain thatÂ some action to address climate change is necessary.

No. A state-mandated ban on murder does not violate the NAP. Murder violates the NAP. Banning murder obviously does not violate the NAP.

On the other hand, taxation does violate the NAP. Taxation even violates the NAP if the tax revenue is spent to prevent murder.

Now You may argue that this is desirable or necessary, that without taxation to fund the enforcement of the ban on murder that more murder will happen, and you can argue that the increase in murder would violate the NAP even more.

But none of that changes the fact that taxation violates the NAP and any system predicated on it is unlibertarian.

&gt;Exactly. It isn't a strictly libertarian stance... because for some issues there isn't a ""strictly libertarian stance.""

Hardly. Libertarianism is a pretty complete ethical framework. Given certain axioms, you can very easily determine whether something violates the NAP or not.

Abortion is not a very good analogy to what we're talking about. Even so though, given presuppositions, it's very easy to determine whether or not abortion violates the NAP.

It is unbelievably vague and only even suggests ""extreme"" end of one side that could still be ""libertarian.""

The current Libertarian platform states climate change is a real threat and pushes for legislation aimed at curbing it.

Honestly... that kinda qualifies as ""serious government action"" right there... and has SHIT TO DO WITH TAXES.

The equivalent of the 1979 minimum wage would be $10.47 today, and there are a lot of workers under that. According to [this study](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2019/11/21/low-wage-work-is-more-pervasive-than-you-think-and-there-arent-enough-good-jobs-to-go-around/), 44% of workers today are low wage with a median income of $10.22/hr. That means over 22% of workers are making less than the equivalent minimum wage in 1979.

There's no doubt that neoliberal policies have helped those are the top earn more, but they're still leaving a lot of people outside the opportunities afforded to those with capital. If you have to work extra hours to make ends meet, you don't have time to educate yourself to get out of a low wage job.

And planned obsolescence, or ""value engineering"", is most certainly a real thing. I work with hardware and see it creeping into everything. There's no reason for laptop manufacturers to solder RAM to the board or for TV manufactures to choose a single cheap capacitor that they hide away. The entire TV is built to last, but they specifically choose that capacitor because it has an expected life slightly longer than the warranty, and bury it so labor costs to repair it are higher, making you more likely to buy a new one.

I'm dealing with my MacBook which suffered from Flexgate, which is caused by the flex cable being a few mm too short and wearing out, and even though it's a $10 part, they soldered it behind the screen so it's an $800 repair (Apple stores just replace the monitor), on a computer that's worth $1000 now. Guess I'll just buy another. Wrong! You just cut the cable and solder an extension onto it, but now I can't use it to travel anymore because you can't open and close it a lot after you make the repair.

There a reason startup companies like Framework have a months long waiting list for their computers. Simply because they're built to be easily repaired and upgraded. It has the profile and performance of a MacBook, and is as expensive as a MacBook pro, but even though they have no name behind them, there's demand simply because it's not value engineered.

And as for the environment, EVs area good step forward, but as batteries become more in demand, issues with metals, mining and waste will become an issue. Sure, we can innovate some sort of recycling, but recycling is often misunderstood. Nothing that we recycle goes back to the quality its original state. A more appropriate term would be ""downcycling"", because each time it's processed, it gets less usable. This is why, even though localities collect recycling separately, they often just dump it ina certain section of the landfill to ""recover later"", or more likely never. 

You can't just mix different types of plastic, and companies like BASF are designing plastics that could be tracked on the Blockchain for effective recycling, but even just simple plastic is still a long way off from being truly recycled. Batteries are much more complex and it's unclear is we'll be able to truly recycle in the near future.

You make a lot of good points. As I said, my argument isn't that neoliberal policies didn't increase some metrics. My biggest issue with neoliberalism is it just seems to be concentrating power in fewer and fewer hands, as uncontrolled capitalism always does. 

The absurdity that we just watched with the pandemic, where the Fed pouring money into financial markets, made billionaires 70% richer while so much of the working class is struggling, is just neoliberalism operating as designed. Social programs were able to drop poverty rates from 13% to 9% and keep people from becoming homeless, but why are we handing out money to those who don't need it? Talking heads like to blame rising labor costs for inflation, yet don't blame corporations like Amazon and Kroger's, which are reporting record profits.

For a capitalist system to truly promote individual liberties, it can't keep concentrating wealth and power into fewer and fewer hands. It becomes an oligarchy.

Capitalism needs to be balanced with social programs. While Americans were during at home during COVID, enrollment in online courses to learn new skills skyrocketed, as did a proliferation of content creators teaching people how to live better with less money, like coming healthy at home.

For capitalism to evolve into a better system, maybe we should consider ways to spread the wealth. Sure, Elon is innovative, but there's only so much a single person can do. The Falcon 1 rocket only cost $90 million to develop. What's he doing with all his billions? 

What if you took just one of those billions and handed out $20k to 50,000 entrepreneurs to innovate ways to strengthen their local economies? That could have a major impact and maybe create a sustainable marketplace for something like local, healthy food production.

The overall trend is the same. Between 1979 and 1990, when the minimum wage was raised 4 times, the percentage of workers working at or below minimum wage fell from 13.4% to 5.1%. 

&gt;The equivalent of the 1979 minimum wage would be $10.47 today, and there are a lot of workers under that. According to this study, 44% of workers today are low wage with a median income of $10.22/hr. 

That study is seriously flawed. Firstly, it only counts not just full time but also part time workers, so anyone who worked low wage jobs at some point during the year would be counted, even people who aren't working those jobs now. This doesn't really say much about the economic health of workers. Secondly, it excludes all of those who are self employed *or* earned self employment income as well as those working in family businesses. Convenient. Thirdly, the people who are classified as *low wage* are those who earn less than 2/3 of median income, even though any other study considers less than 1/2 of median income low wage. And the median income being considered is only that of full time employed men, which would obviously further skew the threshold upwards, and even though it counts part time workers but somehow expects them to earn 2/3 of full time workers. It doesn't count any other form of income, self employment, government transfers, and it also doesn't count non wage forms of compensation like health insurance premiums, bonuses, overtime etc, which make up a significant amount of total compensation, on average 30%.

&gt;There's no reason for laptop manufacturers to solder RAM to the board

Soldering RAM to the board cuts costs and increases reliability, especially since most people never upgrade the RAM on their laptops anyways, and so it doesn't make sense to keep a socket. 

&gt; The entire TV is built to last, but they specifically choose that capacitor because it has an expected life slightly longer than the warranty, and bury it so labor costs to repair it are higher, making you more likely to buy a new one.

Source?

&gt;I'm dealing with my MacBook which suffered from Flexgate, which is caused by the flex cable being a few mm too short and wearing out, and even though it's a $10 part, they soldered it behind the screen so it's an $800 repair (Apple stores just replace the monitor), on a computer that's worth $1000 now.

Charging high prices for repairs isn't planned obsolescence. And you can probably get third party mechanics or services which can fix it for you at cheaper rates. 

&gt;There a reason startup companies like Framework have a months long waiting list for their computers. Simply because they're built to be easily repaired and upgraded. 

Ok? That still doesn't prove planned obsolescence though. Different companies have different priorities, goals and objectives. Some want to keep costs low, some want to charge higher prices and gain higher profitability. Framework focused on customisability and high demand, which was a strategy which paid off. 

&gt; issues with metals, mining and waste will become an issue.

Not if we begin asteroid mining, which is a very real possibility. 

&gt; My biggest issue with neoliberalism is it just seems to be concentrating power in fewer and fewer hands, as uncontrolled capitalism always does.

It concentrates wealth, not power. And wealth is not zero sum, everyone is getting wealthier and richer than ever before, not just the rich. So I don't see the problem. 

&gt;The absurdity that we just watched with the pandemic, where the Fed pouring money into financial markets, made billionaires 70% richer

The Fed didn't make billionaires richer, the American people did. Since people were stuck in lockdowns, and they couldn't spend as much on consumption, they instead decided to invest into financial markets instead, which they could do easily and earn shitloads of money on, while making billionaires richer at the same time. The financial markets were down significantly, so everybody decided to buy when the stock prices were down. That is not absurdity, that is common sense. If a large number of people invest in an asset which is predominantly owned by billionaires, those billionaires are going to get richer. 

&gt;Social programs were able to drop poverty rates from 13% to 9% and keep people from becoming homeless, but why are we handing out money to those who don't need it?

Because they hire millions and millions of workers whose livelihoods are on the line? Because they provide cheap services to consumers at a time when those services are sorely needed? 

&gt; Talking heads like to blame rising labor costs for inflation, yet don't blame corporations like Amazon and Kroger's, which are reporting record profits.

Amazon's profits rose primarily because of AWS, not because of its retail sector. And Kroger has a razor thin net profit margin of 0.75%. What has happened is that the quantity of stuff Kroger is selling has gone up, so it's absolute profits rose. Surprise, when demands surge due to handouts, but supply doesn't, prices rise. This is not some neoliberal conspiracy, it's econ 101. 

&gt;Capitalism needs to be balanced with social programs

It already is. Essentially no neoliberal developed country has a lack of social programmes. Not even the US. I don't understand why you think neoliberalism is somehow antithetical to social programmes. Social programmes can and do exist in every neoliberal country. 

&gt;While Americans were during at home during COVID, enrollment in online courses to learn new skills skyrocketed, as did a proliferation of content creators teaching people how to live better with less money, like coming healthy at home.

Ok, and? That's still neoliberalism at work. 

&gt;For capitalism to evolve into a better system, maybe we should consider ways to spread the wealth. Sure, Elon is innovative, but there's only so much a single person can do.

There's no limit to what a man like Musk can do. He's commercialized electric cars to an immense extent, created a company which is worth more than most gas car manufacturers combined while selling like a fraction of their output, and reduced the cost of sending a kilo of payload into space by 99%. 

&gt;The Falcon 1 rocket only cost $90 million to develop. What's he doing with all his billions?

Surely this is a joke question right? You think Musk has some Scrooge Mcduck type vault where he stores his money and swims in a sea of gold coins? 100% of his wealth is invested in Tesla and SpaceX. All of it. He has stated this before. He barely has any money in the bank. He lives at the Tesla factory. 

&gt;What if you took just one of those billions and handed out $20k to 50,000 entrepreneurs to innovate ways to strengthen their local economies?

That means batteries and the need to generate a surplus of electricity when they are running to provide for the demand when they can't run.  Batteries are terrible for the environment, not only from a disposal perspective (because you will have to dispose of them and replace them as they age), but also from a construction perspective.  They're also terrible for human rights (lots of child/slave labor goes into mining the materials needed for batteries).

Oh, and your electric car needs these batteries, too.

Those batteries require lithium, cobalt, and nickel, among other materials, to make.

The US is a net importer of lithium and cobalt.  US imports around 50% of the nickel used in the country.  Some years it may import more than 50% and other years, it may import less than 50%.

Point being, switching everything to electricity that requires batteries doesn't make the US energy independent, either.  It just shifts which countries the US would be dependent on.

That's not to say that the US should stop looking for ways to be energy independent.  But the goal should be actual independence, not ""well, at least we're not relying on *those* people anymore.""

Solar panels don't work at night, so you would need enough of them to generate a surplus of electricity so that you can provide for the (admittedly lower) demand at night.  That brings us back to the need for batteries which are, as previously discussed, their own kind of problematic.

The alternative is to have a power plant that can generate electricity by consuming some sort of fuel that can be stored and used on demand and where the power plants can have their output adjusted downward (potentially even to zero) when they are needed less and adjusted upward when they are needed more.

Coal is pretty good for that, but even ""clean"" coal burns really dirty.

Natural gas is excellent for that, and the emissions from natural gas plants are downright clean compared to the cleanest coal plants.

Nuclear is also excellent for that, and its only emission is water vapor.  Granted, it does have the waste disposal issue, and that's a pretty major one.

&gt;It blows my mind that libertarians would hate on EV's and solar panels.

I don't hate EVs, nor do I hate solar panels.

My problem with EVs specifically is multi-pronged, but at least some of it will be handled by the market (lack of infrastructure, lack of range on basic vehicles, long charging times, the vast majority of them looking hideous and having no capacity for hauling firewood, etc.).

The problems I have with EVs that are less likely to be solved by the market is that they aren't the answer to pollution.  They just shift some of the pollution to a different part of the supply chain.

Everyone harps about how EVs produce zero emissions.  That's just not true.  They don't produce them at the tailpipe, sure.  But unless you are on a 0% emission power grid (and if there are *any* natural gas or coal plants on your grid, you're not), they produce emissions every time you plug the vehicle in to charge.  *That* is a problem the market can, and will, I suspect, fix over time.

For example - pollution: we tax it or fine it thinking it will go away or Corporate America will solve it for ""us"" (us meaning the government).

In reality, the solution to our pollution problem comes from clean energy (in my opinion). We should fund clean energy meaning nuclear power, solar power, wind power. Once we have solved the problem, then we should look at making changes to the polluters. 

As an example - Car Pollution:

We burden auto manufacturers to create lower emission vehicles. While this is a great theory, it is a problem without a solution. Creating lower emission vehicles will create lower emission vehicles (duh), but it doesn't *solve* pollution problems it only *reduces* pollution.

A true solution would be to invest in electric cars which are zero emission. HOWEVER, the electricity comes from primarily polluting power plants (say that 3 times fast) today. So, we also need to fund nuclear power plants (cleaner) and solar/wind/water power plants. 

Without solving the problem at the root, we're just prolonging the problem. It's not the easy way, so politicians haven't done it yet.

A metaphor:

Imagine two men walking through the forest and they come upon a river. In the river are drowning children. Hundreds of them. Flailing and gasping. 

The two men jump into the river and start saving children as quickly as possible.

One of the men climbs out on the other side and starts moving upstream. The second man yells ""Hey! Where are you going? We have to save these children!""

The first man yells back, ""I'm going to tackle the guy throwing these kids in the river!""

The moral of the story - we can continue putting policies in place that pull children out of the river (low emission cars) OR we can invest the time and energy upstream to keep the kids from being thrown into the river in the first place (clean energy).",True,,False,,,,0,1646669821,,False,0,{},hzpv2z9,False,t3_t8s7wo,False,False,t3_t8s7wo,/r/Libertarian/comments/t8s7wo/what_is_the_best_solution_to_third_party_effects/hzpv2z9/,,,1655786310.0,5,True,False,Libertarian,t5_2qh63,r/Libertarian,public,,0,[],,,2022-03,False,,t1_hzpv2z9,,False,,,,2022-03-07 09:17:01

That's not even close. Electric cars can charge off of a regular wall outlet ($0). If you want faster charging, you can plug into a 220v outlet, which most houses already have ($0). If yours isn't located in a place where you can plug into it, then you can get the parts for a new circuit for about $25 plus $3/ft from the breaker. So that's less than $100 for a 15ft run. If you can't do things yourself, then a qualified electrician can do the job in 2 hours. If your electrician charges $100/hr, that's a total of $300. **In other words, the necessary infrastructure is already in place.**

&gt;I was replying directly to another Redditor that just claimed there was nothing on the lot..

Right, the dealership lot. Dealerships aren't the only places to get cars. **The cars are available** - just not through dealerships. This is because dealerships tend to be risk averse.

&gt;What, do you shop for cars online and never test drive them or have a peek on the inside?

You can test drive them and peak inside with online stores.

I've purchased vehicles (including EVs) from dealerships, from online sellers, from manufacturers directly, and from individuals directly.

&gt;Both are condescending and vindictive. What if you don't want an electric car or want to code.

Then don't. Same as if you don't want to eat. Nobody is making you. But if you choose not to eat, then complain about being hungry, someone is probably going to tell you the obvious solution to your self-imposed problem. And if you choose not to learn a valuable skill, then complain about difficulty earning an income, it would be reasonable for someone to recommend learning a valuable skill. And if you choose to build your life on a resource that is becoming scarce like petroleum, then complain about the cost of the resource, it would be reasonable for someone to recommend that limit your dependence on that resource.

Simple searches prove you're not accurate in your response. You make it seem like the cheap way to go is well cheap and you get what you pay for. But to charge an EV to full on this system would require a full 24 hrs.. Some people that work regular jobs don't have 24 hrs. They get home after work and probably have a maximum of 12 hrs.

So, its likely they will need the system in the price range I already suggested.

And not everywhere in inner cities have charging stations. And practically, you need to wait up to an hour to charge so you can get anywhere (probably get home) to then charge your EV again.

And its definitely not practical in terms of long term mileage. To get any decent miles in EV's you need to purchase the bigger battery packed cars.. Thats just the facts.

2. Dealerships have been a primary source to get new and used vehicles. They always have been. So, you're saying everyone should just use the panoramic camera online then purchase cars? Wtf?

When making big purchases, its always wise to go and test drive the car. Go in and out of it.

The ONLY exception to this is when you purchase used cars that are incredibly cheap.

3. If you think you're smart, then you're smart is hardly the case in this circumstance.

There is a difference to seeking alternatives than to use condescending avenues of communication like 'Learn to Code' or ""Buy an Electric Car"". Its the ""OK Boomer"" approach.

Its stereotypical. Its not being resistant to change.

And steam power was amazing back in the day. In fact, steam power is still being used these days (like in Nuclear power generation), which is in part the biggest and best source of power for your EV plans. But hey, you want to knock steam power..

I do think the oil companies are taking advantage of the media hype. I think gas prices would have spiked regardless of the pipeline, though I do believe prices would be a bit lower. 

However, for all this talk about being energy independent, the American people still drive around gas guzzlers. You talk about ""expensive electric cars"" but the top 3 cars in the US are gas guzzling pickup trucks that are also expensive. 

1. Ford F150 - $30k base cost
2. Ram Pickup - $35,500 base cost
3. Chevy Silverado - $32,500 base cost

Electric cars
Nissan Leaf - $27,400 base cost
Chevy Bolt EV 1LT - $31,995 base cost
Chevy Bolt EUV 1LT - $33,995 base cost

Electric is on average less costly than the most popular vehicles in America which are gas guzzlers.

No, I did the math for you. You're simply wrong.

The vast majority of trips are not long distance.

No I'm not saying that at all. I can tell you've never considered buying a car online, which tells me how old fashioned and stuck in the past you are. But all of the problems you're highlighting have been solved.

Yes, online stores let you do that.

Fuel efficiency standards have correlated with more fuel efficient vehicles, but those standards didnât create innovation.  Where the innovation fell short they had to make more small cars and reduce the weight on cars which likely has a negative safety component.  Companies get charged based on their fleet gasoline efficiency and they can exchange credits with other companies.  Which increases the cost of Fords letâs say and increases the cost of Teslaâs.  Which is a pretty regressive move if you look at the incomes of the drivers of the respective cars.

Electric cars are only as clean as the power from the plant that is used to power them.  So you are often times exchanging pollution that you see with that that you donât see.  If we want EVs to be as clean as you seem to want to pretend that they are then we need more nuclear power.  Which we could then supplement with wind and solar.

There isnât enough known Lithium deposits in the world to create enough batteries for a fleet of electric cars.  Maybe that changes in the future as increases in demand creates an incentive for further exploration and even new methods at finding materials.  

Are we better off with all this intervention and government putting its hand on the wheel?  Itâs hard to find a lot of direct proof.  All you really end up doing is creating an incentive for technology that isnât quite ready yet.  If solar panels make sense for people to buy you donât have to create an incentive.  The incentive is already there.  

We didnât need to create incentives to move off of horses and onto automobiles.  Now maybe you think we should have avoided cars.  Well imagine the whole waste scenario of cities with a million horses instead of cars.  Similarly we donât need government meddling now.  When clean energy becomes competitive the move will be one that you couldnât really stop if you wanted to.  

None of which is to say that the government hasnât had some positive impacts or that it couldnât in the future.  Politicians arenât experts on these things though.  They donât know the difference between a promising technological development and one that is a complete fraud.  So any scheme that has them doling out funds isnât going to be a good one.

But there are many problems. The courts are not easily accessible (IE: expensive), and harm is difficult to prove. Or there may even be laws that prevent suit. These would be part of the ""government interference"" argument. If the government makes it hard or impossible to sue polluters, then logically it is their fault that people are not holding polluters responsible. 

I do think within the Libertarian community there is a problem where when we consider a problem we look until we find government involvement. And then we stop looking. In my opinion this is insufficient. In this case, lowering the barriers to lawsuits may not actually be a good idea. For one thing, polluters can use courts too, and they are better at it. They can and do use lawsuits to intimidate people into not holding them accountable. Laws that prevent suit are usually not actually relevant once you look at them more closely (although in the cases where they are relevant it is particularly egregious). 

And all of this ignores the possibility of people simply not buying from polluters. To me, this illustrates the core issue. Most people think pollution is bad. In a theoretical Libertarian society, they should stop supporting polluters financially. But they don't. They see pollution as ""someone else's problem"", and continue to buy the cheapest polluting crap that serves their needs.

theyve changed the CMIP model many many times.  science is about making predictions then trying to falsify them, thus proividing a better understanding of physical reality.  its not simply stating what ""could be""

i think it was already mentioned but about costs of climate change, and to debunk green's argument, you can watch Alex esptein debunk it here.

Watch out he's a grammar Nazi on a crusade against EVs even though he is not at all informed on the matter. 

In general the price of any vehicle has risen to a sometimes prohibitive level. With that said there are some cheaper EVs like the Nissan Leaf, I believe it starts at under 29k.

This probably doesn't help you as you need a truck. The base model Ford f-150 lightning is just under 40k when I checked last. 

It's surprisingly not that expensive, especially if arguing that EVs are too expensive and that's why we should slow adoption.

#[RECORD FIRSTS IN PRESIDENT BIDEN'S FIRST YEAR](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/01/19/fast-facts-record-firsts-in-president-bidens-first-year/)


President Biden and Vice President Harris delivered results for the American people in their first year in office. The President and Vice President made history growing our economy, addressing the climate crisis, and building a judiciary and government that represents America. Despite unprecedented challenges, 2021 was a year of record progress for working families.

* **Jobs:** President Bidenâs first year was the greatest year of job creation in American history, with more than 8 million jobs created.

* **Unemployment Rate:** The unemployment rate dropped from 6.2% when Biden took office to 3.9%, the biggest single year drop in American history.

* **Unemployment Claims:** The average number of Americans filing for unemployment has been near its lowest level since 1969. When the President took office, over 18 million were receiving unemployment benefits, today only 2 million areâalso the biggest single year drop in history.

I don't even understand the point of this. 

Gasoline engines are cheaper to produce than hybrid or pure electric ones and as electric car usage increases then commercial gas will decrease due to lesser demand, making gas engines even more economical for those who are trying to stretch every dollar as far as possible. 

Being opposed to the regulation of gas engines because you understand the underlying economic pressure that it will place on the middle class is a lot different than whatever, 'BIG FUCKING TRUCK"" is supposed to allude to.

* He's brought electric cars that people actually want to buy to the mainstream, forcing other automakers to release EVs far faster than they otherwise would
* He's made large scale battery power storage a thing, which is absolutely necessary if you desire a clean energy grid
* He's made re-usable rockets a reality, drastically reducing the cost to get mass to orbit.  
* He's actively working towards putting humans on Mars and actually has the means to do so.  If we waited on NASA for this, we would perpetually be 2 decades away from humans on Mars.
* He started two other interesting companies (Neuralink and the Boring company) which may some day show promise.  

Now let's look at the list of why people hate him:

* He called a guy a pedo on Twitter
* He's bad-mouthed the SEC on Twitter
* He wants to buy Twitter and actually stop banning/blocking people (apparently this warrants hatred)

One of the first things you'd have to ask yourself is: is someone doing something that's infringing upon my will as per a logical order of operations?

For example, is someone pouring hydrochloric acid into a stream that runs into a pond you own?

Another thing you have to do is find objective, empirical evidence that what is happening actually has some kind of adverse effect. Climate change is real, but the actual long-term effects are not completely quantifiable at this time. In addition, there's loads of evidence showing that the primary culprits aren't the general populace. Most of it seems to be coming from the largest governments and corporations, not every day people. Then you have to consider which nations are producing how much in total, and per capita. For instance, just looking at CO2 emissions by nation (in tons), China is at 10,432,751,400, while the US is only at 5,011,686,600. That's about 1/2 the level. In addition, the top 5 countries with the highest CO2 emissions per capita are Palau, Qatar, Trinidad and Tobago, Bahrain, and Kuwait. The US is number 13, even below Australia and Canada.

So this means, ***WHO*** exactly is the state supposed to intervene against? If you could even cut China's emissions in half (5,216,375,700 tons), that would be the equivalence of cutting 100% of the US's emissions, and then some, or the almost exact equivalence of cutting 100% of the emissions from Russia, Japan, Germany, Canada, Iran, South Korea, and Indonesia combined (with some left over), the 4th through 10th highest CO2 emitting nations on the planet.

Then you have to ask yourself what your plan actually is.

Say that you think forcing manufacturers to make electric cars and making it illegal to own an automobile with a combustion engine is part of your answer. Well, according to the US Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks (1990-2019), transportation (ALL transportation) accounts for only 29% of total US CO2 emissions as of 2019.

29% of 5,011,686,600 is 1,453,389,114 . That would reduce global emissions only when you account for the top 10 emitting nations on earth, by a paltry 5.38% (there abouts).

But what would the impacts be in that kind of legislation? And why should Americans fit that responsibility, instead of say, the Chinese? Can you afford to buy an electric car? The average cost of electric vehicles (per [cnbc.com](https://cnbc.com)) as of 2021 (pulled from the Kelly Blue Book) is $56,437, which is roughly $10,000 higher than automobiles with combustion engines.

Even if you could solve that problem (which I would argue you can't), you then need to consider the level of infrastructure required to maintain all those electric vehicles (EVs). If all cars in the US were EVs, we would need a national electric infrastructure of about 1,106.6TWh. That's 27.6% of what the ENTIRE AMERICAN GRID produced in 2020. So we would need to produce 27.6% more electricity than we currently do.

And that's not all. That doesn't account for all the infrastructure required. There's particular alternative manufacturing requirements for EVs. EVs are mostly battery, not really engine. EV engines are a lot simpler, containing far less moving parts, but the battery system of an EV is massive, and none of those batteries last forever, and cost more than the entire engine would once they no longer hold a charge. They also reduce by about 2.5%ish or so of total charge potential every year, which can vary depending on where you live.

Then you have to outline the whole nation in EV charging stations. There are about 109,307 charger ports in the US. For the US to even keep up with current EV sales, not even considering we're nowhere near a 100% EV ratio, would require that we install around ***478 such stations per day for the next 8 years***.

And who's going to pay for all of that?

Also keep in mind that 61% of our electric grid is generated from fossil fuels - coal, natural gas, petroleum, and other gases, with about 19% of the remainder from nuclear energy.

So when we try and boost that energy grid up by the predicted 27.6%, well over half of that is going to come from fossil fuels.

One last thing to keep in mind: The US government spent $6.82 ***trillion*** in 2021. Even if you robbed every single American billionaire of every single dime they own, right down to the last penny, that would only generate $4.18 trillion. That wouldn't last us more than maybe 3-4 years of this kind of spending. Remember, these billionaires aren't making $4.18 trillion per year, that's their total combined wealth. Once you take it and spend it that first year, it's gone. The second year 100% of it comes from the regular folk like me and you.

We love modern gadgets, solar panels, and all that stuff. We want electric cars that are just faster and better than gas guzzlerz. Yeah green is cool, let's take advantage of that and make more of it to sell.  
The best strategies that we have seem to come from a market based approach anyways. A carbon tax is a market based approach. Based on the sale of privately produced carbon emission products, that are then taxed for carbon. *This might be why Elon Musk promotes the idea, being that his products directly compete with gas powered vehicles and coal power plants.* Just as a minor retort to your name drop.  
Cap-and-Trade Program(s) are another market based strategy, but I'm a critic of this program. Setting caps for gross-emitters and fining them when they go over. Which they don't mind, as they just increase consumer costs to cover their losses. But shouldn't the consumer shoulder some burden for consuming the energy as well? Maybe we should, if we buy the products that are harmful to the climate.   
Both Cap-and-Trade and Carbon Taxes are only just ways to stack state money. They don't a meaningful effect on carbon output, until that money is used to subsidize or build green energy. Which we are doing through private markets.   
Another problem is we are also subsidizing carbon emitters, government vehicles still run on gas, states bans on nuclear energy, etc. etc.

The power of social media is helpful to convince consumers to buy green products. That's private social media companies helping private markets fight climate change.

I think the answer lies in technological innovation and increasing standards of living. Technological advances in things like solar panel efficiencies, thorium nuclear, even things like better insulation for houses, are all things that can help combat emissions. The free market is the best way to obtain these advances. Even current technologies for nuclear power are stymied by governments (from what I understand). Fifteen years ago, solar panels on homes were not able to generate enough electricity to pay itself off during the life of the panels. Due to government carrots and sticks, some of those homes still have those old, inefficient panels. Now, the new panels' costs offset in 10 years with no tax rebates.

Likewise, we see that rising standards of living tend to make it so that people can afford to be more environmentally conscious. Electric cars aren't cheap, even to first world countries. Looking at third world countries, pollution gets even worse since they have to burn dirtier fuels for energy and struggle to obtain basic sanitation. Again, the free market is the best way to get people out of poverty. While we can't do a whole lot in other countries, we can start by getting the world's biggest polluter (the US military) out of conflicts that are making those areas even poorer than they were before we got there.

Something I would add is that neither situation needs to be an absolute.

You can regulate guns more, and you can regulate cars more. Regulation should be an ongoing process and does not need to include outright bans.

New car regulations were brought out in the UK in 2018, and I think we have revisions every year or so. The 2018 AEVA (automated and electronic vehicles act) covered regulation of electric vehicles.

Why is this needed?

Because things change. Society isn't static, and the law shouldn't be either. The whole point in law is to solve problems stemming from unregulated behaviours.

You could quite easily argue that:

- When the gun laws in the US were written, the average lifespan was 60 years, so fighting age was 14-40, and therefore gun ownership at 18 was sensible, but now that people live longer, the fighting age for modern US is more like 21/24 - 60, so private gun ownership should adjust accordingly.

- When the laws were first written, guns only fired at a rate of less than 5 rounds per minute, therefore public ownership should be limited to comparable rates of fire.

- There was no ability to perform background checks when the laws were written, so perhaps early US lawmakers absolutely would have looked at your Facebook to see if you had nazi flags and bomb manuals before they handed you an AR-15 with silencer and lazer sight.

Further when we shut down things like pipelines and make it harder to move oil and refine it even if a lease is productive it might have significant costs to bring that oil to market. This 'Oh but you have so many leases' argument from Biden doesn't ring true when you have him saying 'I'm going to shut down oil production'. So which is it? Is he pro domestic production or Anti?  In reality it doesn't matter, just the hint of going back and forth leads to uncertainty in the market which just drives up prices.

There are plenty of the greenies that say 'Oh if the US had European gas prices we would demand to be green'. That might be true but forcing a system like that means it will be a very painful transition. The kind of transition which governments rarely survived in past eras. It would be the sort of thing that encourages revolution, sharpening guillotines, or at a minimum war against neighbors over resources. The only way to have a peaceful transition from fossil fuels is to have it market driven without jolting up prices. You need to have people want to transition away without forcing them. So oil production should continue to grow for the foreseeable future. Then let the government encourage development of new technology, eg fundamental research in EV or other types of fuel. If everyone wanted to buy a new EV and oil prices dropped oil production would naturally take a dip without blood in the streets. No one has the stomach for this cold turkey approach to fossil fuels. What is their plan when there are no more trucks bringing food. Sure gas prices are expensive now, they really suck. But when they get past a breaking point and trucking just stops, electricity production just stops, what is their plan? Do these people really want to see the entire country fall into a post katrina hellscape for months and likely years? 

The only good thing about Biden complete selling out to the progressives is people are going to see just how bad things can get with a  progressive unleashed in complete control. 

And if you need any more proof on how damn insane the progressives are. They are currently trying to push price controls on Russian oil. And they want to use access to banking markets to force all countries that aren't on board to accept these price controls. Eg everyone that is the US or Western Europe. It will never work, to the extent that it does it will only hurt those other countries more. It will be economic colonialism which would require enforcement at the barrel of a gun. 

Progressives just don't understand how big and complex global systems and markets are. They think you can get good outcomes by just dictating them and never have to worry about market participants being rational actors that will do the best thing for their own needs. What will end up happening is their policies will backfire and then the only way to force the outcome they desire is with guns. Where market based policies supported by strong economic theory would have policies align incentives such that market participants choose to do as we would like based on rational acting. Eg Russia is starting a war and benefiting by higher oil prices we the solution is to flood the market with production from other places. Drop the price and starve out the Russians. Market prices reflect not only current costs but try and predict future costs. So making commitments to increase production that would be difficult to back out of would have a downward pressure on prices. Biden could reverse the shutdown of the Keystone Pipeline XL. Sign a treaty with Canada to create the pipeline, throw in some environmental protection to monitor for spills and minimize those putting the cost on the producers and call it a win all around.

This happens SOOO much in IT, and you would be appalled at how much taxpayers money is wasted because a once decent hardware/software model falls a part, and the cost of replacing the existing with a new vendor is intense. Those vendors know this and exploit it to the max. 

Mandatory Standardization in widely used devices is necessary and is better for everyone.  Take EV chargers. Tesla vs Ford vs Chevy vs GMC vs Toyota.  It's ridiculous.  It's all the same voltage input and output. The design difference is purely exploitative.  

Gasoline is a standardized fuel option. There are minute differences that overall don't impact the overwhelming majority of consumers.  But imagine the issues if Ford used Propane for sedans and butane for SUVs. Chevy uses Propane and Butane but vice-versa. People would be using the wrong fuel all the time and destroying their vehicles. 

Back in the day, Novell used its own proprietary networking standard that was replaced by an industry standard, I.e. TCP/IP. 

Standardization in many consumer products is best for everyone, except shareholders, and quite frankly, Apples, Amazons, etc...they're already fighting for their product to be ""the industry standard"". Kinda like vaccines.  Big Pharma collude sometimes.  But Big pharma are also in competition to get their product to market to meet consumer need/demand. 

Standardization isn't a zero-profit thing. Also, it can be great for startups, too. WiFi standard was developed by the CSIRO, an Australian Government-owned research organization.  PayPal was a startup, and is now a standard platform almost everywhere.  So, just because products and services become standard, doesn't mean that we're eliminating ""the free market"" entirely.  I'm sure there's going to be a new widget that's going to solve another major problem, and you can bet Samsung, Apple, Nokia, Amazon, Google, etc...are working on it. The first one to get it to market wins.

I'd argue oil and gas demand is inelastic regardless of what the government does because we can't live without it. No matter what the price is, people still have to get to work or school, companies still need to transport materials to make things or ship finished products, etc. And there aren't immediate substitutes. It's not like we can just buy Pepsi or just drink tea or water if we aren't happy with the price of Coke. Gasoline prices are relatively fixed across all providers whereas a transition to electric vehicles, mass transit, etc. are big, expensive, long-term decisions.

Meanwhile, it's not like oil and gas companies just charge us production costs plus a modest margin. They charge whatever the market will bear, just like any other private company.

Point being, true free market capitalism works best when demand for a product or service is elastic and the price will be proportional to fluctuating supply and demand. But when demand is relatively fixed, regardless of price, consumers get screwed.

If you doubt this, ask yourself this question...

If I were governor, I would build a facility for the homeless on the fringes of the metro areas of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Maybe Stockton for San Francisco or Perris Valley for Los Angeles. Tiny houses, large apartment buildings, Nissen huts, tents - whatever gets the job done. From there they can get treatment to deal with whatever drug addiction that they have. They can leave once they are clean, they can live there if they want full-time if they want. We could have bus service that takes them back to the cities; again whatever gets the job done. Maybe you can have them leave at anytime. 

But we should not allow them to live in tents on our streets and subways or begging for money at every freeway entrance and exit and outside every school. Being homeless should not be a crime, but refusing help should have consequences. They do not deserve to be housed at a nice downtown hotel for free while the rest of the population is struggling to pay rent. 

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

&amp;#x200B;

If I were Newsom, I would set ambitious priorities to get the state off gasoline:

Build a man-made lake in the California desert or someplace in Nevada east of Reno (with obvious coordination with the state of Nevada)

Build nuclear power plants next to those lakes. Use the water from those lakes as coolant for the nuclear power plants. One can now have a massive and cheap quantity of electricity on hand.

Implement the construction of further infrastructure to make the majority of vehicles in California electric. Let's say pass a law to make Amazon's vans electrically powered. 

For households, offer a tax break/ major incentives if they install an electric vehicle charging apparatus in their homes. The idea is that every garage in California is equipped with the means to charge their electric vehicle when it is parked there. 

Do whatever is necessary to accelerate the mission of electric vehicle battery-swapping companies such as Ampel. This company is a game changer in terms of making electric vehicles a reality for everyone. Instead of going to a gas station or waiting for your vehicle to charge, you can go to a battery swapping station instead. This would be one way for vehicles that are not normally parked in garages to be all-electric. 

That would be my vision for California if I could do what I wanted. Otherwise, people will continue to leave California, Illinois, and New York like they are doing now and going to conservative states like Texas, Florida, and North Carolina further diminishing Democratic chances of winning the House of Representatives in the near future.",True,,False,,,,0,1657127889,,False,0,{},if3jhwh,False,t3_vqpdwk,False,False,t1_ievobkh,/r/democrats/comments/vqpdwk/newsom_airs_political_ad_in_florida_targeting/if3jhwh/,,,1659923963.0,1,True,False,democrats,t5_2qn70,r/democrats,public,,0,[],,,2022-07,False,,t1_if3jhwh,,False,,,,2022-07-06 11:18:09

3516915,[],,HMMOo,1514005967.0,,,[],,,,text,t2_p5k2mpx,False,False,,"So it's not bad to be idealistic, but you need to keep in mind some the practicality of these solutions which you pose here, especially if you are passing judgement on the governor. It's great that you've thought of solutions but it's not helpful if some of these things are largely impossible to accomplish.

&gt;If I were governor, I would build a facility for the homeless on the fringes of the metro areas of San Francisco and Los Angeles. Maybe Stockton for San Francisco or Perris Valley for Los Angeles. Tiny houses, large apartment buildings, Nissen huts, tents - whatever gets the job done. From there they can get treatment to deal with whatever drug addiction that they have. They can leave once they are clean, they can live there if they want full-time if they want. We could have bus service that takes them back to the cities; again whatever gets the job done. Maybe you can have them leave at anytime.

This idea isn't necessarily bad, however moving something like 10k people from the SF bay area 2 hrs to Stockton of all places is simply ridiculous. There's a reason that this issue largely rests on the mayor's shoulders, because it's not only more efficient, but more achievable for each city to handle the issue in their immediate area. Expecting the state to not only build a massive facility to house all these people, but also get them there is a pipe dream. Affordable housing has to be built where they're needed; this can obviously be incentivized with state funds but ultimately has to be initiated and run by the city/mayor's office.

&gt;They do not deserve to be housed at a nice downtown hotel for free while the rest of the population is struggling to pay rent.

My understanding is this was mainly spurred on by COVID, and was mutually beneficial for both the owners of the properties and the homeless. The homeless got a place to stay and the owners earned a significant amount of money during a time where they were struggling because of the reduction in travel. Also, if you look at how Houston fixed their homeless problem, this was an essential step of it, so this isn't necessarily a terrible idea. The bottom line is more housing simply needs to be built, especially affordable housing.

&gt;Build a man-made lake in the California desert or someplace in Nevada east of Reno (with obvious coordination with the state of Nevada)  
&gt;  
&gt;Build nuclear power plants next to those lakes. Use the water from those lakes as coolant for the nuclear power plants. One can now have a massive and cheap quantity of electricity on hand.

Nuclear is out of the question and despite what people say, is not the future. There simply isn't enough public or political drive to support these power plants in the future. Newsom is having a hard enough time extending the life of the power plant at Diablo, so building a whole new hundred million dollar facility is impossible. Furthermore, the idea of building a lake in the middle of the CA desert is laughable; do you have any idea the water crisis that's been going on for the past decade?

California is a great place for solar farms, why not support those? The land itself is not exactly easy to come by, but it would be much cheaper that building more nuclear power plants. There's even talks about putting solar panels over the LA Aqueduct which would not only provide power but mitigate water evaporation. Also, this is before Newsom's time as governor, but every new home of a certain size has to be built with solar; expanding this would be a great idea.

&gt;Implement the construction of further infrastructure to make the majority of vehicles in California electric. Let's say pass a law to make Amazon's vans electrically powered.

It's unreasonable to expect the government to unilaterally decide that a private company must do something as drastic as electrify their whole fleet of delivery vans. As EV's expand, so too will Amazon and other delivery services expand with EV's. We have to help the whole sector of EV's grow in the state which I wholly support. Theoretically Biden's infrastructure bill should supply more money for building more charging stations which should help as well.

Car availability are a whole other issue though when we look at the shitshow that COVID caused with the car market. It seems like car manufacturers are moving in that direction however. Realistically, I don't know how much more Newsom as governor can do about this. CA already has the strictest emissions regulations in the US, and because of it's size, dictates the emissions for the whole of the country. Furthermore, they have offered rebates on the purchase of plug-in hybrids and EV's in the past, so expanding these would probably be a good idea.

&gt;For households, offer a tax break/ major incentives if they install an electric vehicle charging apparatus in their homes. The idea is that every garage in California is equipped with the means to charge their electric vehicle when it is parked there.

This is a great idea. CA and the federal government has done this with electric and plug-in hybrid cars, and we should do it for charging stations; this should help make EV's more accessible.

&gt;Do whatever is necessary to accelerate the mission of electric vehicle battery-swapping companies such as Ampel. This company is a game changer in terms of making electric vehicles a reality for everyone. Instead of going to a gas station or waiting for your vehicle to charge, you can go to a battery swapping station instead. This would be one way for vehicles that are not normally parked in garages to be all-electric.

IMO, it would be much easier and cost effective to just wait for the battery technology to improve to the point where range is comparable, however this approach isn't necessarily a bad idea. 

&gt;Otherwise, people will continue to leave California, Illinois, and New York like they are doing now and going to conservative states like Texas, Florida, and North Carolina further diminishing Democratic chances of winning the House of Representatives in the near future.

Firstly, I doubt any of the points you mentioned were a huge driving factor for people to leave the state. It's mostly because of the cost of living and housing has exploded, as I've mentioned before. If anything we want more democratic people moving to more republican states that way they can turn states purple or blue. The blue and red districts in CA are extremely entrenched as it is, and Californians are already disenfranchised solely by living in CA, so going to a place where you votes mean more would be a good thing for democrats.",True,,False,,,,0,1657243485,,1657243666.0,0,{},ifabbb1,False,t3_vqpdwk,False,True,t1_if3jhwh,/r/democrats/comments/vqpdwk/newsom_airs_political_ad_in_florida_targeting/ifabbb1/,,,1659912419.0,1,True,False,democrats,t5_2qn70,r/democrats,public,,0,[],,,2022-07,False,,t1_ifabbb1,,False,,,,2022-07-07 19:24:45

Way to prove you know nothing about the situation. EVs can charge on *both* 120 and 220/240v. Also, the amperage is **lower** on 220v, because of how electricity works.

&gt;Who wants to stop at a charging station every two days

Again, misrepresenting data. There are far more gas cars on the market, no duh more have sold, that's basic arithmetic.

&gt;Who's going to run an extension cord out their window

Don't need to. Most garages have outlets inside, and with GFCI, outlets can safely be placed outside without fear of water damage.

&gt;Simple 6 hour trip

I don't think you understand the definition of the word ""simple"". Regardless, super chargers exist. They charge the car in a fraction of the time (roughly half an hour). That makes them a good place for a bathroom and stretch break!

OK? Still has absolutely zero relevance.

The problem is that those costs aren't salient as climate change. When my electricity usage in July is up because the A/C is on longer, I don't have to pay a bill to ""climate change"" is just a bigger bill to my utility. When food prices go up because climate change exacerbates droughts, I don't see that part of the increase is climate change.

What kind of statist moron believes that oil barons getting billions of dollars a year in government subsidies is libertarian in any way shape or form?

""Energy independence"" is a sham.  The reason we're buying oil from other sources is because its cheap.  We could pay more for completely domestically sourced crude and the invariably more expensive consumer facing products at the pump, and they would be more expensive, a sacrifice Americans simply aren't willing to make.  Instead they'll bitch about KXL being closed because clearly, the entire reason that a foreign pipeline developer was going to build thousands of miles of pipeline was to provide cheaper consumer goods to Americans.

I'm not a Democrat nor a democrat apologist, but in the long term, $10/gal gas is far more likely than not, and EV's cost considerably less per mile to operate than a comparably sized ICE powered vehicle, even if they have higher upfront costs.  A Nissan Leaf is a $27-35k EV depending on configuration.  I see them used on my local Craigslist with some regularity inside of $16k depending on age, condition and miles.

That's one of many articles that shows how the US electrical grid, (not including Texas) is quite capable. 

Does everyone have their own personal gas pump? Do you fill up everytime you drive?

Obviously not, so don't apply that absurd logic to electric vehicles.

Installing residential and public charging stations is not that difficult. I've installed several different types in several different scenarios. 

The biggest issue with electric cars is the public being able to afford them, and battery tech.

The charging infrastructure will take time and money, but it's completely doable and manageable.

Obviously not, so don't apply that absurd logic to electric vehicles.

Electric cars need to be charged more often per mile than an ICE car needs to be filled up. How is there any correlation between the usage habits?

Yes EVs aren't as efficient in terms of fuel vs. mileage at this point, I am quite aware of this.

I am also quite aware of the issues with battery tech.

I think both of these factors will be mitigated with technological advancements already in the pipeline.

Feel free to mock my language which attempts to prove my point that you are misunderstanding. I'm saying that charging in general will not be difficult. 

I can say with firsthand experience that installing chargers is pretty affordable and easy to do. I can also attest to employers and shops/restaurants installing convenience chargers as well.

Not to mention the plan to install chargers along the interstates throughout the country.

This means that beyond personally owned chargers you will have a ton of other places to charge too. And since not every car has to charge all at once we do not need one charger per car, even though most owners will have a home charger.

So we probably will have a closer ratio of one charger per car than one pump per car.

Hence my comment on not needing a gas pump for every car. 

Your concern about habit is not very concerning to me or most others. A relatively small group of the public require filling their car up everyday due to travel. Of course this doesn't include industrial transportation, but that's a whole other conversation.

What habit changes other than not needing to make a stop for gas when most people will have residential chargers at their home, or access to street/garage chargers in the cities?

Again, consider ACs, they are a constant heavy draw that is within almost every household right now. 

Car charging is not like that, especially with the smart charging capabilities of the chargers and the vehicles themselves. I know teslas allow you to regulate charging through the car itself. Due to this I've been able to install a 30a charger in a 60a service to an apartment in the city and the customer is able to charge his car sufficiently.

It's definitely a likely scenario that people simply plug their vehicles in when they get home from work out of habit regardless of battery level.

But again this is not heavy of a load in comparison to other electrical appliances/tools that are ubiquitous in modern housing. 

For example, you may have a 200a 42 space panel for a larger home. If you simply added up the rating of only 20 or so breakers you will likely be well above the 200a service rating, but that's not an issue since not everything is running full bore all at once. 

There are certainly more things to consider when planning a house's circuitry, but that gives you a general idea.

Utility lines are much higher voltages, but it's the same idea. You are limited by equipment like transformers and line size. Those items can be upgraded and added as necessary.

As I keep saying, this will take some time and money but we aren't that far behind and our grid/companies running the grid are quite capable of handling mass EV adoption.

That's okay, but let me explain first.

The idea that anyone thinks the grid can support 100% transition to electric vehicles is preposterous. The idea that any plan is followed to the letter and not updated as bench marks are met is preposterous. 

What this bill does is incentivize people to create companies to invest in new infrastructure in California. This means at the consumer level, such as electric vehicle charging stations, and at the state level with power generation. We have a lot of unused land that can effectively used to satisfy two problems; cannabis cultivation and energy production. Various power companies in California, and outside, are the few existing companies that can plan for new energy production, but they won't make these investments if the ROI isn't there. You see this on store shelves sometimes, a product will sell out because it's better to have sold everything instead of product sitting. Energy companies don't want to invest in energy production if they can't get paid for it.

2035 will not mandate zero gas cars being sold. You will still be able to buy a 2036 gas car in California, either because it's listed as used or you purchased from out of state. What will happen is most of the population will move to electric vehicles as they become more affordable and as infrastructure grows. When your local gas station becomes gas/electric, then becomes electric with one gas pump, then the price of gas continues to go up and up.

Then the intention sucks.

Think of it this way only 3.3 percent of vehicles registered in California are battery electric and the period they ask people not to charge them is 4-9 pm.

If they doubled that to about 7% of all cars,  that time period is going to grow not shrink.

Not to mention Can their grid handle 7% of all cars plugging in right at 10 pm to charge?  An EV draws more power than an AC unit does by a large factor.

11kWh for a model 3, versus 3 kwh for an AC unit in a 2,000 sq ft house.

and some households have more than 1 car. 

Literally  1 car is the same load as 4 houses running AC.

I think EVs are awesome.  California implementing a ban on gas cars, before announcing a plan to massively improve their grid is incredibly stupid.
